1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,400
Okay, so I want to get started today by talking a little bit about read-me's.

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:19,680
How many of you in project one, how many of you did a proper read-me for the first time

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,080
when you're writing GitHub projects?

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,040
And I'm talking about a public open source read-me, I'm not talking about a read-me that

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,320
you submit with build instructions and stuff, a read-me that has screenshots and that has

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,800
performance analysis.

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,800
Anybody else raising their hands?

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,800
Okay, so I see a few more.

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:46,120
So remember, the reason read-me's are important is because when people like myself, we are

10
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,360
going out there and looking for really, really smart students to hire, it's very unlikely

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,800
that I'm actually looking at your code and your algorithm.

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,840
Like I'm sure they're amazing, all of you sitting in this room are probably the smartest

13
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:06,040
people that are graduating this year, but I'm not always looking at your code, I'm looking

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,040
at your results.

15
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,920
I'm looking at the impact you've created, and that is seen through your reading.

16
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:19,080
So as much as you put into your project, let's say for project zero, you spend five days,

17
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,560
for project one, you're going to spend a week, for path tracing, you're going to spend more

18
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,560
than two weeks on it.

19
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,920
The result of the two weeks is summarized into your read-me, so imagine how much impact

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,920
that should have.

21
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,880
So let's talk a little bit more about that.

22
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,840
Let's talk about what makes for a good read-me, what do people look for, and you always want

23
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,840
to remember the audience.

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,840
So let me touch on the audience a little bit.

25
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,160
How many of you have spoken to recruiters, company, technical recruiters, people from

26
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,440
HR reaching out to you?

27
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,440
Probably everybody, right?

28
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,680
If you've looked for an internship, you've looked for a job, you've spoken to them.

29
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,960
How many of them are actually technical?

30
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:05,320
How many of them have written maybe 15 lines of code in their life?

31
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,320
Very, very few.

32
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,320
Right?

33
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,760
Most of them probably zero.

34
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:14,760
So they don't always understand if you give them super technical information, and that's

35
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,400
going to be your first audience.

36
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,640
Most of the time as a student, if you're getting into an interview process, you're likely doing

37
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,840
a phone screen with an HR person.

38
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,040
And your job at that level is just to get to the next step.

39
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,800
It's not to convince the HR person that you're the most amazing, if you're able to do that,

40
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
fantastic.

41
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:41,960
But what the HR person is going to look for is, hey, if I recommend this to my technical

42
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,040
lead, is he going to continue the process?

43
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,840
Or is he going to think that I'm basically like, that's kind of the decisions HR people

44
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,840
are trying to make.

45
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,280
So you want to be speaking to them.

46
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,000
And then you also want to be speaking to people like me, who are very technical, who understand

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,480
the work you're doing, and want to see that, hey, this student is really smart, and I want

48
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,480
to hire him because he's doing amazing work.

49
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,200
So you want to be able to balance both of those things.

50
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,200
So let's look at those tips about what makes for a good readme and how you should structure

51
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,200
it.

52
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,880
The first thing is that you want to provide your context and your contact info.

53
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,800
Talk a little bit about the project, not in full detail.

54
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,320
You should start with what is this project?

55
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,640
It's performance analysis, it's CUDA points, it's a path tracer, you know, very, very simple,

56
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,640
very succinctly.

57
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,760
And because you're in the position of, hey, here's my information, if you like my project,

58
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,880
reach out to me, share your contact info.

59
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,320
You may not do that later in your career, like if I'm writing an open source project,

60
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,320
it's unlikely that I'm putting my contact information up front.

61
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,320
But in your position, you want to be doing that.

62
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,760
You want to share your contact information, your LinkedIn, your GitHub, so that anybody

63
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,880
who's looking at the project is able to reach out to you, okay?

64
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,320
And you want to put your best image up right up front, you know, very clearly that showcases

65
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,960
exactly the work you've done.

66
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,640
And then once you've passed that, you want to show a little bit of walkthrough, you know,

67
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,360
use screenshots, use debug images about what you've done.

68
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:26,040
So this is a great example from a few years ago about how, I believe this was computer

69
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,040
vision, right?

70
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,440
So how you take an input, run it through different algorithms, what are the intermediate stages,

71
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,840
and how you come to the end result.

72
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:41,000
And what this shows is you have a clear understanding of the work you've done, and a clear understanding

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,480
of how to explain the work you've done.

74
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,440
You can be the smartest engineer, inventing the craziest algorithms.

75
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:54,560
But if you're not going to explain the value of that algorithm, and how it benefits the

76
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,520
team you're working on, people are not going to understand it.

77
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:07,120
So it's really important to communicate clearly and succinctly what the flow is, and how to

78
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,760
understand it.

79
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,400
And then you also want to annotate, again, going back to, you know, let's say, the audience

80
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,640
of HR people, they may or may not understand what a CUDA path tracer is.

81
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:27,320
Maybe somebody at NVIDIA does, but maybe somebody at, you know, pick your favorite new company

82
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,920
probably doesn't understand what a path tracer is, and what's involved in a path tracer.

83
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,320
So you want to annotate, you want to showcase the different features.

84
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,840
We, most of us in this room are coming from a graphics background, so we understand what

85
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,080
the different features in this kind of an image are.

86
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,720
There's reflections, refractions, caustics, and other things.

87
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,800
But the average run-of-the-mill HR person, or even the software developer who doesn't

88
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,640
have a graphics background, isn't going to understand this feature.

89
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:03,000
Not all of this comes for free, so you want to be able to highlight those.

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,520
And then you want to include debug screenshots.

91
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,160
This, I cannot state this enough.

92
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:15,880
If you include debug screenshots, I am going to give you brownie points, because what it

93
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:22,440
tells me is, you know how to use a debugger, you know what the steps in the process are,

94
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:28,840
you understand the different phases of your algorithm, and you're able to use that information

95
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,800
to then make your algorithm better.

96
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,240
It checks so many boxes that I'm pretty sure those four points that I said aren't even

97
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,480
covering it.

98
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,960
Debug images are some of the, if other than the best screenshot you put up there, debug

99
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,520
images are probably the best thing you can add in your read, okay?

100
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:55,280
So they really communicate the value that you understand your algorithms and your implementation.

101
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:02,240
So the other thing is, you also want to include side-by-side comparisons.

102
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,320
It's one thing to include one image.

103
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:10,400
If you just include this image, something like this or this, it's fine.

104
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,400
You know, we get it, we've all seen smooth spheres, nothing new.

105
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,200
But what you want to explain is, this is non-default.

106
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,560
You actually had to put in work to get it to be smoother.

107
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,600
This is default, this hard edge thing, and it doesn't look like a sphere, not to the

108
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,000
average person at least.

109
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,440
So having these side-by-side comparisons of the before and after of your work really help

110
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,440
the average reader understand what you're trying to implement and how you're trying

111
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,600
to improve on your work.

112
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Bloopers.

113
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:55,000
So I spoke a little bit about this in last class, but again, just like debug images,

114
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,920
bloopers are amazing in showcasing that you as a developer are able to overcome problems.

115
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:09,400
Bloopers are a perfect example of that because they show that you stumbled, you ran into

116
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,360
a problem, but you were able to overcome that.

117
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,480
How you overcame it is something for your interview, you know, when you get to your

118
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:22,280
interview and the interviewer asks, tell me about a time you ran into a problem.

119
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,560
And boom, you're like, hey, can you open that, read me and see that screenshot?

120
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,480
Because now you're going to talk about something like this and be like, I ran into this, I

121
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,600
didn't know what was happening, I was only getting red and green and my path tracer didn't

122
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
work.

123
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,600
And then you start talking about how you solved it, right?

124
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:44,840
They're a perfect way of showcasing the problem you ran into visually, rather than just telling,

125
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:50,120
oh, I ran into this bug in a for loop, you know, and people won't get it.

126
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,200
You show this, people understand what this problem is.

127
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,000
Even if they don't know all the algorithms behind it, they understand, yes, that is a

128
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,320
problem that doesn't look right.

129
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,360
But when you show them your main screenshot that actually looks right, it clearly shows

130
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,000
that you were able to overcome it.

131
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,840
And then you tell the story of how you overcame it.

132
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:15,120
A few other bloopers I'll show again, from previous years, that was a void run.

133
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,400
How many of you did something like this in your voids?

134
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,400
Yeah, see, you're not alone.

135
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,480
People are, you're walking in the footsteps of many people who've come before you.

136
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,680
And I've run into the exact same problems you have.

137
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:37,520
So don't worry, don't feel that, oh, I'm, if I'm posting a blooper on that discussion

138
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
or anywhere that it's been embarrassing.

139
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
No, not at all.

140
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
We are all running into this.

141
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200
I've been in your shoes once upon a time.

142
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:47,560
I've done way worse, trust me on that.

143
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,200
So really, really important to share bloopers.

144
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,880
Here are a couple more.

145
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,200
An inverted ducky, what's happening there, anybody guess what's happening there?

146
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:06,600
Especially our graphics folks.

147
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,680
The camera's perspective is wrong.

148
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,680
Yeah, I think that's it.

149
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,080
Yeah, the projection matrix is backwards, exactly.

150
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,080
The thing is rotating completely inverted.

151
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:24,480
This is from the path tracer.

152
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,560
I'm foreshadowing this, but this is from the path tracer.

153
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,400
If any of you run into this, please post it on that discussion, okay?

154
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,600
Anybody guess what's happening there?

155
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Sorry?

156
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:53,000
Yeah, and they're probably also not doing any bounces and things like that.

157
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,720
And they're also not computing the normals correctly, I think.

158
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,720
Okay.

159
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,040
So as you can identify who did this.

160
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,040
Sometimes they look amazing.

161
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,160
Again, I'm not showing this because I want to brag or anything, although I think it's

162
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,760
pretty cool.

163
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,760
Anybody guess what's happening here?

164
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,600
This wasn't in the old 5.6.3 that we had, it was a fluid simulation.

165
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,720
Anybody guess what's happening?

166
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:28,440
Let me back it up again.

167
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:40,400
And then slow it down as well.

168
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
It's not the simulation.

169
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
What's going on here?

170
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,400
What looks weird in this?

171
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
The color.

172
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,400
What about the color?

173
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:58,400
So let me pick a nice place and stop it.

174
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,360
What's weird about this?

175
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360
Great.

176
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,360
Yeah.

177
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,360
How did that happen?

178
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:20,920
So that happened because I had a bug in my code, and I'm talking about 2012 spring, okay?

179
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,200
So literally more than 10 years ago.

180
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:30,120
That happened because I had a bug in my OpenGL code where I was not clamping my color values

181
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,320
between zero and one.

182
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,160
So they went all sorts of ways, and they kind of like looped around, and they gave me really

183
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,920
cool ring out of it.

184
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,160
So complete bug, but it looks amazing.

185
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,160
So I can pass it.

186
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,160
Okay?

187
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,000
All right.

188
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:57,040
So any questions on images and debug views and bloopers so far on readings?

189
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:07,160
All of these in here are probably project two doesn't have any visuals, but hopefully

190
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:13,200
some of them are definitely in project three, right?

191
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:20,040
And don't worry about going and revisiting and updating these things, okay?

192
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,040
We will grade them.

193
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,000
You're free to work in a branch that you want, and once you receive your grade, go update

194
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
that project.

195
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Please do that.

196
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I encourage you to do that.

197
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,880
Just because the project is done and you've graded, it doesn't mean that repo is dead.

198
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,880
Okay?

199
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,720
All right.

200
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,720
So let's see.

201
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,720
All right.

202
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:44,800
So to recap, you want to do your images and stuff.

203
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,720
You want to add your bloopers, and for video and animated GIFs, the cellular tools, Lyscap

204
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,720
used to be a good one.

205
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,720
Screen to GIF is really nice.

206
00:13:52,720 --> 00:14:01,720
If you're capturing videos, OBS, Open Broadcaster Studio, I think it's really good for videos.

207
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,280
So be sure that you're optimizing the settings.

208
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,280
Capture it in full HD.

209
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:11,320
Don't skimp on the resolution and stuff, so be sure to do all of that.

210
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,320
Demos are really good.

211
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,600
If you want to put a live demo link or something, it's good.

212
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:20,520
If you're putting in build instructions, that's good as well, so be sure to do that.

213
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,520
Include performance analysis.

214
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,040
You've done that as part of project one.

215
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,920
You'll certainly do that as part of project two, and be sure to continue doing that.

216
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,240
Again, it shows that you understand the value.

217
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,480
Even today, like this morning, I was talking to one of my engineers at Cesium who's working

218
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,640
on improving how textures are loaded, and I'm like, okay, you're going to work on this,

219
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,480
but tell him how much improvement I should expect.

220
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,480
Should it be 5%?

221
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,480
Should it be 15%?

222
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,320
Should it be 15%?

223
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,880
So just being able to get even preliminary numbers that showcase what the potential of

224
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,960
a feature improvement is becomes really, really valuable.

225
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,880
And then lastly, this line is A here.

226
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,360
There's 30 of you in this class.

227
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:16,200
There's probably hundreds of you across DMD, CGD, robotics, CIS, et cetera, right?

228
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,280
You want to focus on what you...

229
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,680
Even within the 30 projects in this class, you're going to have differences.

230
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,680
You're going to work on different things.

231
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,680
You're going to work on extra credits, right?

232
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,920
You want to highlight those.

233
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,920
I can...

234
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,520
Any recruiter I can connect with, I can be like, hey, go look at my CIS 5, 6, 7, 8 rules

235
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,960
and tell me which one would be good.

236
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,080
And what they're going to look for is how to differentiate.

237
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,200
They're going to see five projects that all look the same, and they're going to think,

238
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
oh, this is average.

239
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,200
Right?

240
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,200
They're going to...

241
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,080
Even if you've done the best one, you're going to have the five best projects, but they're

242
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,680
going to look, hey, these guys all did the same thing, so maybe there's nothing special

243
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,680
about it.

244
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,760
So it's as if you focus on what you need by showcasing side-by-side comparison, by annotating

245
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,760
your images.

246
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,000
That's how you differentiate yourself.

247
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,520
Even though you may have done the same implementation, focus on what's unique about you and then

248
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,520
highlight that.

249
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,520
That's the key thing.

250
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,280
You want to be able to communicate that value so that it's creating an impact that is helping

251
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,800
you get those interviews, helping you get those jobs, right?

252
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,360
So that's the ultimate goal of these read-me's.

253
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:30,320
Any questions on this?

254
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,360
So I've linked a bunch of really good read-me examples.

255
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,200
I'm not going to open most of them.

256
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:43,200
There's also a link on more of read-me guides and stuff, so all the links for you to check

257
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
out.

258
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,840
Now let's talk a little bit about graphs.

259
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,880
This is a graph from Anand's site.

260
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,880
I'm sure most of you have read similar charts like this.

261
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:58,880
What are some properties of a good chart?

262
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,880
This chart is an example of a good chart.

263
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,880
Tell me what are the key things in there that make it good.

264
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,880
Yeah, just shut up, you don't have to read it.

265
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,880
Well-annotated, and then some of these, whatever.

266
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,880
Tell me which part of it is well-annotated.

267
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,920
Well-annotated, well-annotated, well-annotated, well-annotated, well-annotated.

268
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:26,920
It sounds like it's already labeled but it says better so you know which one's better.

269
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,920
Yes, so yeah, I've highlighted on something very, very important that a lot of students,

270
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,920
and not just students, even professionals, miss on.

271
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,920
This very line here, higher is better.

272
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,920
How many of you did a chart, and put a point where you used time?

273
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,960
Probably at least half of you, if I remember correctly, maybe more,

274
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,960
where you're like, how much time did a simulation take,

275
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,960
or how many frames per second did something take, right?

276
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,960
Time is usually lower is better.

277
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,960
But if you're drawing a line like that, I'm going to think higher is better,

278
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,960
if you don't specify it, right?

279
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,960
So even in this chart, you always want to mention higher is better, lower is better.

280
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,960
Good point here.

281
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,960
What else is good about this?

282
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I think...

283
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Exactly.

284
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
So in these, both of these issues are different, except these two,

285
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
which are more flat, you have a founder's edition and a regular edition.

286
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
And then the 2080 and the 2080 founder's edition are similar products.

287
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,040
And then you have 1080 Ti and 1080 here, which are similar products.

288
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,040
So if you are doing, you're preparing different algorithms

289
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,040
with different settings within the same chart,

290
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,040
give them similar colors, okay?

291
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,040
You may give one light blue and dark blue,

292
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,040
you may give one yellow and orange kind of thing,

293
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,040
but make sure the colors mean something, okay?

294
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,040
What else?

295
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,040
What are some other good charts?

296
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:08,080
He specifies the configuration, the resolution, the quality.

297
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,080
Absolutely.

298
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,080
It says what was actually tested.

299
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,080
What else?

300
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,080
Yeah, good.

301
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,080
Yeah.

302
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,080
Yeah, especially when the lines are this close,

303
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,080
like especially for example, 161.8, 161.7, 161.6,

304
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,080
if these numbers one that you didn't have, right?

305
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,080
So you want to make sure that when it's this close,

306
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,080
you're always putting the number in.

307
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,080
What else is good about this chart?

308
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,080
Who's the audience for this?

309
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,080
Sorry?

310
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,120
Gamers, yeah?

311
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,120
Technical people, people who are interested in GPUs.

312
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,120
Does this speak to them?

313
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,120
Do they understand everything that's on this chart?

314
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,120
Yes, right?

315
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,120
They understand frames per second.

316
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,120
They understand GPUs.

317
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,120
They understand resolution.

318
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,120
They understand which game is it.

319
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,120
Ultra quality is generally a setting

320
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,120
that most gamers would understand.

321
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,120
So make sure that you understand your audience.

322
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,120
Now, if you show this to a non-technical person,

323
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,120
would they understand it?

324
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,160
Would they know what frames per second means?

325
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,160
Probably not.

326
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,160
They probably don't care.

327
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,160
So you always want to give information

328
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,160
that is right for your audience as well.

329
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,160
So all good points there.

330
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,160
Now, let's see some example of maybe not so good charts

331
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,160
and how we should improve them.

332
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,160
And these are all from previous years in Py65.

333
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,160
Not picking on names or anything,

334
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,160
but let's see why they're not good.

335
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,160
We saw why this is good,

336
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,160
but we also need to understand why they're not good

337
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,160
because if I go back and look at project one

338
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,200
and I'll be sure to share feedback

339
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,200
with you during the training,

340
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,200
is what changes we should make

341
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,200
so that your charts are actually good and useful.

342
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,200
So let's take a look at a few of those examples.

343
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,200
So tell me what's bad in both of these.

344
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,200
We discussed what's good, right?

345
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,240
What is missing from these?

346
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,240
Yeah, doesn't specify.

347
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,240
This time, right?

348
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,240
This time in milliseconds,

349
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,240
I'm going to assume green is better

350
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,240
because it's higher.

351
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,240
Higher to the right is always better by default,

352
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,240
but in this, it's not.

353
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,240
Red is better than this.

354
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,240
So yes.

355
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,240
What else?

356
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:58,280
Red is a bit wordy, yeah?

357
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,280
Because you're essentially saying

358
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,280
CPU line, work efficient,

359
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,280
trust implementations off-scan,

360
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,280
but you're repeating those here.

361
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,280
Average runtime off-scan.

362
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,280
That's it.

363
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,280
Four labels and three lines.

364
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,280
The CPU one, I believe is right.

365
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,280
Maybe.

366
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,280
It looks like that.

367
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,280
So, yeah.

368
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,280
What else?

369
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,280
There is no label for specific data.

370
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,280
The line is continuous,

371
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,280
but we don't really know

372
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,280
what are the actual number values.

373
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,280
You mean something like put a number here?

374
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,280
I would say that depends

375
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,280
on what you're trying to share.

376
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,280
Sometimes it can clutter the chart too much

377
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,320
if you put too many.

378
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
Like in this chart,

379
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
if you're putting four numbers on the lines,

380
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,320
I think that's fine.

381
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,320
If you're trying to put 15,

382
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,320
it's going to look too cluttered

383
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,320
and you won't know what to do.

384
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,320
So that depends on the situation.

385
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,320
What else?

386
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,320
Is this zero to 10?

387
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
Is it zero to one million?

388
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,360
Is it 10 to one million?

389
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,360
I have no idea.

390
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,360
Right?

391
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,360
What should I read in that?

392
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,360
What else?

393
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,360
Definitely.

394
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,360
Why are we zero?

395
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,360
Why are we wasting space?

396
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,360
And again,

397
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,360
we said time in milliseconds, right?

398
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,360
How many of us think 0.025 milliseconds?

399
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
None of us, right?

400
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
So again,

401
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,400
think about what scale you're using

402
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,400
for your time axis as well.

403
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
What else?

404
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,400
Maybe last column B, sorry.

405
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
Any other thoughts?

406
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
Doesn't say what GPU this was or not.

407
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,400
At all.

408
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,400
Anyway, right?

409
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,440
Right?

410
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,440
You can't predict anything.

411
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,440
What else that I can identify?

412
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,440
This one?

413
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,440
Yeah.

414
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,440
Specify it again.

415
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,440
Because this chart,

416
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,440
you're probably going to put it

417
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,440
in your presentation.

418
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,440
Right?

419
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,440
So specify it again.

420
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,440
Say that it takes you five more seconds

421
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,440
to write what GPU it's on.

422
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,440
Don't be stingy on things like that.

423
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,480
Okay?

424
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,480
All right.

425
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,480
Let's take another example.

426
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,480
What about this?

427
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,480
So here,

428
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,480
here what I'll show you

429
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,480
is that the number of units.

430
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,480
Again,

431
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,480
make your chart from your side.

432
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,480
And I'm specifically going

433
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,480
to pick this chart.

434
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,480
How many of you can tell me

435
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,480
the powers of 2 by heart?

436
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,480
I'm sure if you think about it,

437
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,480
you can come up with it.

438
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,480
But if I ask 2 power 13,

439
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,520
who knows the answer?

440
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,520
Right?

441
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,520
So if I ask you 2, 4, 8, 16,

442
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,520
you'll probably get it.

443
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,520
But 2 power 13, 2 power 18,

444
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,520
you know,

445
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,520
we might have to think

446
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,520
about it for a second.

447
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,520
And if we have to think about it

448
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,520
for a second,

449
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,520
where we are talking about

450
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,520
two powers in everyday class,

451
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,520
how does an HR person look like?

452
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,520
Right?

453
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,520
So why are we using

454
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,520
these two powers here?

455
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,560
Use many.

456
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,560
Use hundreds of powers.

457
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,560
Right?

458
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,560
Why use two powers?

459
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,560
Again,

460
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,560
speak to your audience about it.

461
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,560
The other thing I want

462
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,560
to share in this chart,

463
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,560
and maybe I have another slide

464
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,560
for it,

465
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,560
but I'll share it here.

466
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,560
What's wrong with this chart?

467
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,560
Yeah,

468
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,560
the data is just here.

469
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,560
This is the only thing

470
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,560
that matters.

471
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,560
So why are we using

472
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,560
all of this space?

473
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,560
Just get it all.

474
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,560
Just start here.

475
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,600
Right?

476
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
And GPUs,

477
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,600
as I've already said,

478
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,600
are for big data.

479
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
We are not going to,

480
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
we are not going

481
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,600
to be testing in this class

482
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,600
for a rate size

483
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,600
of 2 power 4 versus 16.

484
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,600
You're never going

485
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,600
to test 16 elements

486
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,600
in Wi-Fi.

487
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,600
You're probably going

488
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,600
to test 16,000,

489
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,600
but you're never

490
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,600
testing 16.

491
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,600
So just get it all.

492
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,600
Start from the beginning.

493
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,600
Okay?

494
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
On this slide,

495
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,640
again,

496
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,640
a rate size,

497
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,640
we have something

498
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,640
here,

499
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,640
time in milliseconds.

500
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,640
Okay.

501
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,640
But again,

502
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,640
it doesn't say

503
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,640
high respect.

504
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,640
It doesn't say

505
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,640
low respect.

506
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,640
Right?

507
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,640
I'm going to think

508
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,640
all green line is amazing.

509
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,640
Green line is going up.

510
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,640
Blue line is,

511
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,640
blue line is low.

512
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,640
Blue line is 5.6.

513
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,640
Or,

514
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,640
yeah.

515
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,640
So,

516
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,640
so make sure

517
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,640
you're thinking about it.

518
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
Put your time into it.

519
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,680
You're going to,

520
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,680
you're going to be doing

521
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,680
weeks worth of work

522
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,680
for every project.

523
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,680
But if you make

524
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,680
bad charts like this,

525
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,680
all that

526
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,680
six and a half days

527
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:08,680
of work

528
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,680
is kind of thrown

529
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,680
under the water

530
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,680
because you're not

531
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,680
communicating it correctly.

532
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,680
All right.

533
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,680
So direction we spoke

534
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,680
about it.

535
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,680
And this is a very

536
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,680
good example of this.

537
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,680
Again,

538
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,680
if we go back to,

539
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,680
you know,

540
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,680
things that are

541
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,680
bad about charts,

542
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,680
running time,

543
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,680
you know,

544
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,720
things that are bad

545
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,720
about charts.

546
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,720
Running time

547
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
doesn't say higher

548
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,720
is better,

549
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,720
lower is better.

550
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,720
Array size,

551
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,720
2 power x.

552
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,720
And also look at,

553
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,720
look at this.

554
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,720
We don't really care

555
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,720
about 2 power 2,

556
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,720
but we don't care

557
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,720
about 4 elements.

558
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,720
And almost

559
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,720
neither do we

560
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,720
about

561
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
4,096 elements,

562
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,720
right?

563
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,720
We care about

564
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,720
4 million elements.

565
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,720
So this chart

566
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,720
is completely skewed

567
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,720
from the data it has.

568
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,760
Also doesn't,

569
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,760
doesn't show

570
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,760
higher is better,

571
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,760
lower is better.

572
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,760
So everything

573
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,760
gets messed up.

574
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,760
Now,

575
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,760
we know that this

576
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
is running time,

577
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,760
so lower is better.

578
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,760
So what we're actually

579
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,760
saying is,

580
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,760
yeah,

581
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,760
I did all of this

582
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,760
work for the GPU,

583
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,760
but my TTL is still better.

584
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,760
Charts are not

585
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,760
very communicative.

586
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,760
If you are,

587
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,760
if you are doing

588
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,760
GPU performance

589
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,760
for,

590
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,800
this is at,

591
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,800
at even 4 to

592
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,800
4,000,

593
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,800
right?

594
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
Of course the GPU

595
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
is going to be faster.

596
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,800
The overhead

597
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,800
of the GPU

598
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,800
is going to make it slower.

599
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,800
If this was

600
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,800
4,000

601
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,800
to 4 million,

602
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,800
you're easily

603
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,800
going to make

604
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,800
the GPU look

605
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
a lot better.

606
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,800
So,

607
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,800
this is not

608
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
false.

609
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,800
It's not what

610
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,800
GPUs are meant for.

611
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,800
Talk about why

612
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,800
the algorithm that

613
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,800
you implemented is good.

614
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,800
If you put

615
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,800
a chart like this,

616
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,840
you're like,

617
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,840
hey,

618
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,840
I did all of this

619
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,840
work and my GPU

620
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,840
is still faster than

621
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,840
the GPUs.

622
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,840
Why are we taking

623
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,840
this class?

624
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,840
Right?

625
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,840
Okay.

626
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,840
And,

627
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,840
and like we said

628
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,840
before,

629
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,840
I mentioned that

630
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,840
I probably had

631
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,840
another slide.

632
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,840
Use the number

633
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,840
of elements that

634
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,840
are actually

635
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,840
good for GPUs.

636
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,840
Communicate that well.

637
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,840
If you,

638
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,840
if you are

639
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,840
in doubt

640
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,840
about what the size

641
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,840
should be,

642
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,840
start with 2 power 18,

643
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,840
start with 256,000

644
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,880
That's like

645
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,880
the minimum.

646
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,880
Yeah,

647
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,880
you can go to

648
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,880
64,000, 128,000

649
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,880
but if you're not

650
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,880
sure,

651
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,880
start with this.

652
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,880
You're doing scan,

653
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,880
start with this number

654
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,880
and go to like

655
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,880
4, 8 million

656
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,880
elements.

657
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,880
Okay?

658
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,880
And that's where

659
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,880
the GPU performance

660
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,880
is going to shine.

661
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,880
It's going to

662
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,880
absolutely smoke

663
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,880
the CPU

664
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,880
in performance

665
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,880
and it's going to

666
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,880
make the GPU

667
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,880
algorithm look better.

668
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,880
Okay?

669
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,880
Um,

670
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,880
so,

671
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,920
we already discussed

672
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,920
this,

673
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,920
color lines,

674
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,920
make sure they are

675
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,920
similar.

676
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,920
You can use

677
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,920
light color,

678
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,920
dark color

679
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,920
and stuff like that.

680
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,920
So,

681
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,920
especially if you're

682
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,920
like,

683
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:03,920
let's say,

684
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,920
let's say in our scan

685
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
you're going to have

686
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,920
this naive,

687
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,920
efficient and trust.

688
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,920
Make sure to use,

689
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,920
let's say

690
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,920
for naive

691
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,920
and efficient

692
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,920
you may use

693
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,920
similar lines

694
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,920
and then trust

695
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,920
can be a different color.

696
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,920
Okay.

697
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,920
So,

698
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:19,920
any questions

699
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,960
on this?

700
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,960
All of you

701
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,960
are going to make

702
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,960
really beautiful charts

703
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,960
of project 2?

704
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,960
Okay.

705
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,960
I'm expecting it.

706
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,960
I do,

707
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,960
I spend 30,

708
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,960
45 minutes every year

709
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,960
on this and

710
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,960
you know,

711
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,960
hopefully it's going

712
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,960
to make a difference.

713
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,960
Okay.

714
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:37,960
Last thing I want

715
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,960
to talk about

716
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,960
before we get

717
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,960
into the lecture

718
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,960
is actually

719
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,960
promoting your project.

720
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,960
Okay?

721
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,960
So,

722
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,960
here's a question for you.

723
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,960
How many

724
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,960
of your potential

725
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,960
employees,

726
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
who might be

727
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
have

728
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
some sort of

729
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
a social media

730
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
on any platform

731
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
that is relevant

732
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
to that company?

733
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I should probably

734
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
add Snapchat,

735
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Instagram,

736
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
TikTok to this

737
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
but let's leave

738
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
that out for now.

739
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
But,

740
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
probably every single

741
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
one of them,

742
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
right?

743
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
At least on LinkedIn.

744
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
If nothing else,

745
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
they at least have

746
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
a LinkedIn presence.

747
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Can we all say that?

748
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
On that LinkedIn presence,

749
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
how many of them

750
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
promote their work?

751
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,040
How many of them say,

752
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,040
hey we have

753
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,040
a new product launch,

754
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,040
we have a new feature,

755
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,040
we have interns

756
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,040
joining today,

757
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,040
our interns graduated

758
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,040
today.

759
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,040
How many of them

760
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,040
are saying that?

761
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,040
All of them.

762
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,040
None of them.

763
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,040
All of them are

764
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,040
promoting their company,

765
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,040
their business,

766
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,040
their work.

767
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,040
Okay?

768
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,040
So, why should you not?

769
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,040
What makes you

770
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,040
hesitant to share

771
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,040
your work

772
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,040
on social media?

773
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,040
Choose the platform

774
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,080
of your liking.

775
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,080
I'm not saying

776
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,080
go post your

777
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,080
images on Instagram

778
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,080
where your

779
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,080
friends and family are.

780
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,080
I'm asking

781
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,080
why aren't you

782
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,080
posting them on LinkedIn

783
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,080
where recruiters

784
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,080
are looking for you?

785
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,080
Right?

786
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,080
So, let's take

787
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,080
a look at

788
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,080
some success stories

789
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,080
from this class

790
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,080
about how they've

791
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,080
made a difference.

792
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,080
So, this is from 2018.

793
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,080
This was

794
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,080
Ziyad,

795
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,080
Liam Hall,

796
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,080
Latif T as well

797
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,080
and Henry,

798
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,080
their final project.

799
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,080
This was the first

800
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,120
DXR project

801
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,120
done in this class

802
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,120
and probably,

803
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,120
I'm pretty sure

804
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,120
I can claim this,

805
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,120
the first

806
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,120
student-led

807
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,120
DXR project

808
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,120
in the world.

809
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,120
I'm pretty sure

810
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,120
I can state that.

811
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,120
Okay?

812
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,120
And these guys,

813
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,120
Ziyad,

814
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,120
Henry and Liam,

815
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,120
they spoke about it

816
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,120
extensively

817
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,120
on social media.

818
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,120
They tagged

819
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,120
all the right people

820
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,120
who were doing

821
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,120
DXR

822
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,120
and it got

823
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,120
really popular

824
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,120
and not just

825
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,120
on Twitter

826
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,160
but they also

827
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,160
created blogs

828
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,160
about it.

829
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,160
They actually wrote

830
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,160
down what was

831
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,160
their process,

832
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,160
how did they

833
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,160
build this up.

834
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,160
Again,

835
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,160
in the infancy

836
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,160
of DXR,

837
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,160
there was no

838
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,160
documentation.

839
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,160
I can tell you that.

840
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,160
So, their guides

841
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,160
have helped

842
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,160
countless more people

843
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,160
understand how

844
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,160
DXR works.

845
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,160
So, even if

846
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,160
you don't do

847
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,160
a blog,

848
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,160
make sure

849
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,160
a GitHub readme

850
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,160
is really there.

851
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,160
Lastly,

852
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,160
you know,

853
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,160
be sure to share

854
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,200
on Twitter as well.

855
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,200
A lot of people

856
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
are going to be following

857
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,200
you.

858
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,200
If not,

859
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,200
they'll follow me

860
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,200
and when I retweet it,

861
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,200
we're going to be seeing

862
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,200
a lot of people

863
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
approaching you

864
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,200
about, hey, good work

865
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,200
and things like that.

866
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,200
Trust me,

867
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,200
it happens

868
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,200
and I'm not making it up.

869
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,200
Okay.

870
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,200
Let's see a few more.

871
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,200
So, this was

872
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,200
Ziyad,

873
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,200
I forget his name.

874
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,200
Anyway,

875
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,200
they were doing

876
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,240
a shadow

877
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,240
water

878
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,240
simulation.

879
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,240
Okay.

880
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,240
And they were using

881
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,240
this person's

882
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,240
paper for it.

883
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,240
They put

884
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,240
their image

885
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,240
on Twitter

886
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,240
and thanked

887
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,240
the person,

888
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,240
thanked the author

889
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,240
of the paper

890
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,240
for writing it.

891
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,240
Really cool gesture.

892
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,240
Trust me,

893
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,240
that is the

894
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,240
most amazing thing

895
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,240
you can do

896
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,240
for an author

897
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,240
of a paper.

898
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,240
And when they

899
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,240
put that,

900
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,240
the author

901
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,240
of the paper

902
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,240
replied.

903
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,280
You know,

904
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,280
what happened

905
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,280
after that?

906
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,280
They ran into

907
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,280
a bug

908
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,280
in their final project.

909
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,280
They ran into

910
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,280
an issue

911
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,280
where they couldn't

912
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,280
do it right.

913
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,280
They emailed

914
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,280
the author

915
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,280
and they were like,

916
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,280
hey,

917
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,280
we are running

918
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,280
into this issue.

919
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,280
The author

920
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,280
of the paper

921
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,280
was like,

922
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,280
hey,

923
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,280
make sure

924
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,280
you're doing

925
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,280
X, Y, Z.

926
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,280
And they did that

927
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,280
and they fixed

928
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,280
that issue.

929
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,280
And I,

930
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,280
there is

931
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,320
a paper

932
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,320
not just

933
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,320
in this class,

934
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,320
anywhere.

935
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,320
If you are

936
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,320
going to be

937
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,320
implementing

938
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,320
somebody's work,

939
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,320
I highly recommend

940
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,320
you just

941
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,320
reach out to them

942
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,320
and be like,

943
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,320
hey,

944
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,320
thank you for

945
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,320
writing the paper.

946
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,320
I'm going to be

947
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,320
implementing it.

948
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,320
I'll let you

949
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,320
know how it goes.

950
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,320
That's it.

951
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,320
You will make

952
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,320
somebody's day

953
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,320
by doing that.

954
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,320
And once you

955
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,320
finish that

956
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,320
implementation

957
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,320
and you share

958
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,320
your work

959
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,320
with the author,

960
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,360
okay?

961
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,360
More examples.

962
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,360
So,

963
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,360
you know,

964
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,360
again,

965
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,360
most students

966
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,360
posting their work,

967
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,360
whether it's

968
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,360
on LinkedIn

969
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,360
or Twitter,

970
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,360
it just helps

971
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,360
us amplify

972
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,360
it even more.

973
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,360
It's one thing

974
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,360
me writing

975
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,360
to say,

976
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,360
hey,

977
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,360
we did

978
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,360
an amazing

979
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,360
path tracer,

980
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,360
you know,

981
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,360
go check out

982
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,360
her project.

983
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,360
It's another

984
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,360
thing for you

985
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,360
to write it

986
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,400
and promote

987
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,400
it.

988
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,400
And I'm

989
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,400
just becoming

990
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,400
a microphone

991
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,400
for you

992
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,400
in getting

993
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,400
connected with

994
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,400
the companies

995
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,400
and recruiters

996
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,400
that you'll

997
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,400
be interested

998
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
in.

999
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,400
Okay?

1000
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,400
So,

1001
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,400
that

1002
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,400
project

1003
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,400
here,

1004
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,400
this was

1005
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,400
from 2018,

1006
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,400
Emily sent

1007
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,400
a message

1008
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,400
to Bucket

1009
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,400
around that

1010
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,400
time where

1011
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,400
that tweet,

1012
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,400
her tweeting

1013
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,400
that and that

1014
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,400
getting reshared

1015
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,440
led her to

1016
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,440
have

1017
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,440
an opportunity

1018
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,440
at Xbox

1019
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,440
or to talk

1020
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,440
to Xbox engineers

1021
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,440
and stuff,

1022
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,440
you know?

1023
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,440
And

1024
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,440
that's what you are

1025
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,440
looking for.

1026
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,440
All of you

1027
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,440
in this class,

1028
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,440
not because

1029
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,440
you think,

1030
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,440
yes,

1031
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,440
you learn a lot

1032
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,440
from 565,

1033
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,440
but ultimately

1034
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,440
you're at Penn

1035
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,440
so that you find

1036
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,440
really good jobs

1037
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,440
that pay you well

1038
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,440
and you can do

1039
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,440
really good stuff.

1040
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,440
And being able

1041
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,440
to promote yourself

1042
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,440
is a gateway to that.

1043
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,440
You can do

1044
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,480
a lot of services

1045
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,480
and stuff

1046
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,480
and they'll all be great.

1047
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,480
But

1048
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,480
promoting yourself,

1049
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,480
you won't get to 100,

1050
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,480
you'll get to 100,000

1051
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,480
companies who might

1052
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,480
want to

1053
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,480
see your work

1054
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,480
and

1055
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,480
maybe

1056
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,480
you'll reach,

1057
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,480
you'll get connected

1058
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,480
with companies

1059
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,480
you didn't know

1060
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,480
existed

1061
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,480
and they'll be

1062
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,480
doing really cool work

1063
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,480
and you might

1064
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,480
want to go work

1065
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,480
for them.

1066
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,480
Last couple

1067
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,480
of examples.

1068
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,480
So,

1069
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,480
this was done

1070
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,480
by

1071
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,480
Yusuf Victor

1072
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,480
in 2017

1073
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,520
and

1074
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,520
he did

1075
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,520
a library

1076
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,520
using

1077
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,520
Metal.

1078
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,520
So,

1079
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,520
Metal was brand new

1080
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,520
back then

1081
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,520
and he did

1082
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,520
a random number

1083
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,520
generator

1084
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,520
as part of

1085
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,520
doing a path tracer

1086
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,520
using Metal.

1087
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,520
So,

1088
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,520
this became

1089
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,520
his library.

1090
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,520
A few

1091
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,520
weeks later

1092
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,520
when he checked

1093
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,520
out his library

1094
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,520
he sees

1095
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,520
two people

1096
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,520
kind of following

1097
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,520
that project

1098
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,520
and both of those

1099
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,520
people are from

1100
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,520
Apple.

1101
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,520
Right?

1102
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,560
So,

1103
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,560
it's possible

1104
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,560
that

1105
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,560
a student

1106
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,560
written

1107
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,560
random number

1108
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,560
generator

1109
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,560
for Metal

1110
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,560
was being

1111
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,560
used in

1112
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,560
Apple software.

1113
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,560
I don't make

1114
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,560
claims about it

1115
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,560
but it's possible.

1116
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,560
So,

1117
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,560
last one.

1118
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,560
This is a

1119
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,560
personal one,

1120
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,560
right?

1121
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,560
So,

1122
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,560
when I was

1123
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,560
in this class

1124
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,560
10 years ago

1125
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,560
and did

1126
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,560
the path tracer

1127
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,560
or

1128
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,560
again,

1129
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,560
I wasn't very

1130
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,560
very forward

1131
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,600
so

1132
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,600
we used

1133
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,600
to write blogs.

1134
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,600
Patrick,

1135
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,600
instead of reading

1136
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,600
we used to

1137
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
write blogs

1138
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,600
and Patrick

1139
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,600
tweeted my

1140
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,600
path tracer

1141
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,600
back then

1142
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,600
and using

1143
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,600
this hashtag

1144
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,600
CUDA here

1145
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,600
so,

1146
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,600
a company

1147
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,600
called

1148
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,600
Accelerize

1149
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,600
back then

1150
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
followed

1151
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,600
the CUDA

1152
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,600
hashtag

1153
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,600
because they

1154
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,600
were doing

1155
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,600
GPU work

1156
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,600
and like I said

1157
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,600
I had

1158
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,600
two or three

1159
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,600
followers

1160
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,640
and I'm applying

1161
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,640
everywhere

1162
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,640
and I'm not

1163
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,640
having very

1164
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,640
good luck.

1165
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,640
So,

1166
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,640
Accelerize

1167
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,640
follows me back

1168
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,640
and I'm like

1169
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,640
who is this

1170
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,640
company that's

1171
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,640
trying to

1172
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,640
follow me?

1173
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,640
Like,

1174
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,640
what makes

1175
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,640
me special

1176
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,640
kind of thing?

1177
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,640
So,

1178
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,640
I check out

1179
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,640
their website

1180
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,640
they're doing

1181
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,640
CUDA and

1182
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,640
OpenCL

1183
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,640
work and I'm

1184
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,640
like okay

1185
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,640
apply,

1186
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,640
you know?

1187
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,640
And that's

1188
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,640
what led

1189
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,680
me to

1190
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,680
Accelerize.

1191
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,680
So,

1192
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,680
that's the

1193
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,680
story.

1194
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,680
Like,

1195
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,680
I'm standing

1196
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,680
here because

1197
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,680
of it.

1198
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,680
So,

1199
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,680
I can't

1200
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,680
emphasize enough

1201
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,680
that while

1202
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,680
you may be

1203
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,680
innovative

1204
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,680
or,

1205
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,680
you know,

1206
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,680
being like

1207
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,680
oh,

1208
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,680
I'm just

1209
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,680
a student

1210
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,680
in a class

1211
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,680
who's going

1212
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,680
to care

1213
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,680
about my

1214
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,680
work,

1215
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,680
a lot

1216
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,680
of people

1217
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,680
are going

1218
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,720
to care

1219
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,720
about my

1220
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,720
work.

1221
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,720
So,

1222
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,720
even if

1223
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,720
they're not

1224
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,720
good,

1225
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,720
even if

1226
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,720
you think

1227
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,720
they're not

1228
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,720
good,

1229
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,720
right?

1230
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,720
Trust me,

1231
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,720
you're going

1232
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,720
to be having

1233
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,720
very high

1234
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,720
standards for

1235
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,720
your own

1236
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,720
work.

1237
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,720
The world

1238
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,720
will think

1239
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,720
they're

1240
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,720
me.

1241
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,720
So,

1242
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,720
I encourage

1243
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,720
you to

1244
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,720
always talk

1245
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,720
about your

1246
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,720
work.

1247
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,760
You know,

1248
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,760
just simple

1249
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,760
messages like

1250
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,760
that go a

1251
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,760
really,

1252
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,760
really long

1253
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,760
way for

1254
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,760
promoting

1255
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,760
how you

1256
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,760
work and

1257
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,760
how your

1258
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,760
code looks

1259
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,760
and how

1260
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,760
you're

1261
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,760
thinking about

1262
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,760
software.

1263
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,760
Because

1264
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,760
today,

1265
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,760
you might

1266
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,760
be promoting

1267
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,760
yourself.

1268
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,760
Today,

1269
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,760
you might

1270
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,760
be promoting

1271
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,760
yourself

1272
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,760
through your

1273
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,760
projects.

1274
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,760
But what it

1275
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,760
tells me

1276
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,800
is that

1277
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,800
you have to

1278
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,800
go to

1279
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,800
conferences and

1280
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,800
talk about

1281
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:34,800
it,

1282
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,800
right?

1283
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,800
And that's

1284
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,800
a key factor.

1285
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,800
A lot

1286
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,800
of engineers

1287
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,800
just want

1288
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,800
to be in

1289
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,800
a dark

1290
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,800
room and

1291
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,800
code all

1292
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,800
day.

1293
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,800
But yes,

1294
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,800
they're great,

1295
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,800
no doubt

1296
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,800
about it.

1297
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,800
But I also

1298
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,800
want the

1299
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,800
engineers who

1300
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,800
are going

1301
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,800
to be going

1302
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,800
to conferences

1303
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,800
talking about

1304
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,800
it,

1305
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,840
right?

1306
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,840
Because

1307
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,840
that's

1308
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,840
the key

1309
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,840
factor.

1310
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,840
So that's

1311
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,840
all for

1312
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,840
the slides

1313
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,840
that I have.

1314
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,840
I hope

1315
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,840
I've inspired

1316
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,840
you to do

1317
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,840
a lot more

1318
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,840
around ReadMe.

1319
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,840
But if you

1320
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,840
have any

1321
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,840
questions,

1322
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,840
I'm more

1323
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,840
than happy

1324
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,840
to take

1325
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,840
those.

1326
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,840
So

1327
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,840
yeah.

1328
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,840
Maybe.

1329
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,840
Maybe.

1330
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,840
I'm not

1331
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,840
saying you

1332
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,840
should

1333
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,840
publicize

1334
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,840
every single

1335
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,840
project.

1336
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,840
In this

1337
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,840
class,

1338
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,840
maybe.

1339
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,840
But

1340
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,840
outside of

1341
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,840
this class,

1342
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,840
I can't say.

1343
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:36,840
But

1344
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,840
what I'm

1345
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,840
trying to

1346
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,840
say is

1347
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,840
you,

1348
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,840
let's say

1349
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,840
you get

1350
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,840
to the

1351
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,840
path stage

1352
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,840
or you

1353
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,840
don't need

1354
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,840
project 2

1355
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,840
for the

1356
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,840
next

1357
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,840
project,

1358
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,840
you may

1359
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,840
be producing

1360
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,840
amazing

1361
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,840
charts or

1362
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,840
amazing

1363
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,840
images.

1364
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,840
And you

1365
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,840
may think,

1366
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,840
oh,

1367
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,840
I slogged

1368
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,840
for this,

1369
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,840
I ran

1370
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,840
into so

1371
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,840
many bugs,

1372
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,840
I don't

1373
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:06,840
know what

1374
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,840
my data

1375
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,840
is going

1376
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,840
to be.

1377
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,840
That's

1378
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,840
all fine.

1379
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,840
But take

1380
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,840
that chart

1381
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,840
and be

1382
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,840
like,

1383
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,840
hey,

1384
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,840
I

1385
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,840
implemented

1386
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,840
one

1387
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,840
percent of

1388
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,840
all

1389
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,840
CIS

1390
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,840
programs

1391
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,840
across the

1392
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,840
world.

1393
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,840
I'm not

1394
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,840
just talking

1395
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,840
about

1396
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,840
that.

1397
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,840
That makes

1398
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,840
you different.

1399
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,840
Use that

1400
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,840
to your

1401
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,840
advantage.

1402
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,840
Just because

1403
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,840
you think

1404
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:37,840
you may

1405
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,840
not have

1406
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,840
gotten

1407
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,840
100 out

1408
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,840
of 100

1409
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,840
on your

1410
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,840
project

1411
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,840
doesn't

1412
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,840
make your

1413
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,840
project

1414
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,840
bad.

1415
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,840
But it

1416
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,840
doesn't mean

1417
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,840
if you're

1418
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,840
not getting

1419
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,840
100 out

1420
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,840
of 100,

1421
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,840
your project

1422
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,840
is not

1423
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,840
good.

1424
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,840
So always

1425
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:58,840
remember that.

1426
00:42:58,840 --> 00:42:59,840
The work

1427
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,840
you're doing

1428
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,840
is difficult

1429
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,840
but it's

1430
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,840
also in

1431
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,840
your benefit

1432
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,840
and making

1433
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,840
you look

1434
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:07,840
unique.

1435
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,840
Any

1436
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,840
other

1437
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,840
questions

1438
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,840
or

1439
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,840
readings?

1440
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,840
Last

1441
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,840
one?

1442
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,840
Okay.

1443
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,840
All

1444
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,840
right.

1445
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,840
So

1446
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,840
let's

1447
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,840
move on

1448
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:21,840
to the

1449
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,840
more

1450
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,840
fun part

1451
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,840
of the

1452
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,840
class,

1453
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,840
which is

1454
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,840
performance.

1455
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,840
So

1456
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,840
which

1457
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,840
algorithms did

1458
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,840
we take a

1459
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:32,840
look at

1460
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,840
last time?

1461
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,840
Anybody

1462
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,840
remember?

1463
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,840
Or did

1464
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,840
everybody

1465
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,840
forget?

1466
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,840
Scan?

1467
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:40,840
Okay.

1468
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,840
Reduction?

1469
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,840
Radix sort?

1470
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,840
Some

1471
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,840
area

1472
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,840
table?

1473
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,840
Compaction?

1474
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,840
Yeah.

1475
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,840
That's

1476
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,840
about right.

1477
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,840
Okay.

1478
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:51,840
So today

1479
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,840
we're going

1480
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,840
to take a

1481
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,840
look at

1482
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,840
a bunch

1483
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,840
of these

1484
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,840
algorithms

1485
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,840
and performance

1486
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,840
trade-offs

1487
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,840
and how

1488
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,840
they help

1489
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,840
improve

1490
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,840
the algorithm.

1491
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,840
And while

1492
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,840
we may

1493
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,840
talk about

1494
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,840
specific

1495
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,840
algorithms

1496
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,840
at specific

1497
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,840
times,

1498
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,840
all these

1499
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,840
apply to

1500
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,840
all the

1501
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,840
algorithms

1502
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,840
in

1503
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,840
the

1504
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,840
world.

1505
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,840
You

1506
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,840
optimize it

1507
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,840
for the

1508
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,840
architecture

1509
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,840
and you

1510
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,840
get maximum

1511
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,840
performance out

1512
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:25,840
of it.

1513
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,840
If you

1514
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,840
remove this

1515
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:28,840
yellow box

1516
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,840
here,

1517
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,840
this is a

1518
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:31,840
key component

1519
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,840
of deriving

1520
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,840
maximum

1521
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,840
performance.

1522
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,840
So let's

1523
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,840
revisit

1524
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,840
parallel

1525
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:38,840
reduction.

1526
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,840
Okay?

1527
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,840
So in

1528
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,840
parallel

1529
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:42,840
reduction,

1530
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:43,840
what we

1531
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,840
did was

1532
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,840
we took

1533
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,840
this array

1534
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,840
of eight

1535
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,840
elements,

1536
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:49,840
we added

1537
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,840
them two

1538
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:51,840
at a

1539
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,840
time.

1540
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,840
What did

1541
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:54,840
we do

1542
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,840
next?

1543
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:56,840
Add them

1544
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,840
again and

1545
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,840
add them

1546
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,840
again.

1547
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,840
Everybody

1548
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,840
follow?

1549
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,840
Everybody

1550
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:03,840
on board

1551
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,840
with parallel

1552
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:05,840
reduction?

1553
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:06,840
Hopefully

1554
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,840
all of you

1555
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,840
implemented

1556
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,840
this in

1557
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,840
project 2

1558
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:11,840
already.

1559
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,840
Fingers

1560
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:13,840
crossed.

1561
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,840
The only

1562
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,840
thing is

1563
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,840
which index

1564
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,840
we are

1565
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,840
writing into.

1566
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,840
But they

1567
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,840
read the

1568
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,840
same data.

1569
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,840
Completely

1570
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,840
the same

1571
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:24,840
thing.

1572
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:25,840
This is

1573
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:26,840
kind of

1574
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,840
the code

1575
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,840
for this

1576
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:29,840
kind of

1577
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,840
indexing

1578
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,840
where you

1579
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:32,840
have this

1580
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,840
thread,

1581
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,840
this

1582
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,840
stride,

1583
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:36,840
which dictates

1584
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,840
what the

1585
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:38,840
difference in

1586
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,840
indexing is.

1587
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,840
If you're

1588
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,840
reading from

1589
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,840
one to

1590
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,840
four,

1591
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,840
you see

1592
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,840
how

1593
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:46,840
stride is

1594
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:47,840
less than

1595
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,840
block time

1596
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,840
and you're

1597
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,840
multiplying

1598
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:51,840
stride times

1599
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,840
two.

1600
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:53,840
In multiple

1601
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,840
blocks you

1602
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,840
want to be

1603
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:56,840
loading that

1604
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,840
into shared

1605
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,840
memory so

1606
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,840
you're not

1607
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:00,840
always reading

1608
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,840
from global

1609
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,840
memory every

1610
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:03,840
time you

1611
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:04,840
operate in

1612
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,840
shared memory.

1613
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,840
I don't

1614
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:07,840
know why

1615
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:08,840
my clicker

1616
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:09,840
is doing

1617
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,840
this.

1618
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:11,840
Where

1619
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,840
were we?

1620
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:13,840
I think

1621
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:14,840
we were

1622
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:15,840
here.

1623
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,840
So

1624
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,840
the stride

1625
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,840
you get

1626
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,840
one to

1627
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:20,840
four until

1628
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,840
it's less

1629
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,840
than block

1630
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:23,840
time.

1631
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:24,840
Why do

1632
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,840
we need

1633
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:26,840
signals?

1634
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:28,840
How is

1635
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:29,840
that wrong

1636
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:30,840
information

1637
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:31,840
coming up?

1638
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:32,840
Let's

1639
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,840
say you

1640
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,840
have a

1641
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,840
thread

1642
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:36,840
and you

1643
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:37,840
want to

1644
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,840
load

1645
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:39,840
that into

1646
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,840
shared

1647
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:41,840
memory.

1648
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,840
You

1649
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:43,840
want to

1650
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,840
load

1651
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,840
that into

1652
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,840
shared

1653
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,840
memory.

1654
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,840
You

1655
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,840
want to

1656
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:50,840
load

1657
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:51,840
that into

1658
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:52,840
shared

1659
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:53,840
memory.

1660
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:54,840
You

1661
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:55,840
want to

1662
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,840
load

1663
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,840
that into

1664
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:58,840
shared

1665
00:46:58,840 --> 00:46:59,840
memory.

1666
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,840
Let's

1667
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:01,840
say you

1668
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:02,840
have a

1669
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,840
thread that

1670
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,840
is

1671
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,840
writing

1672
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:06,840
here and

1673
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,840
automatically

1674
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:08,840
jumping here.

1675
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,840
This is

1676
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,840
all

1677
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:11,840
computing.

1678
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,840
Now you're

1679
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,840
reading bad

1680
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,840
data.

1681
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:15,840
Every time

1682
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,840
you write

1683
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:17,840
to shared

1684
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:18,840
memory without

1685
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:19,840
fail, every

1686
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,840
time you

1687
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:21,840
write to

1688
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,840
shared

1689
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,840
memory,

1690
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,840
put a

1691
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:25,840
new thread

1692
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,840
into

1693
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:27,840
shared

1694
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:28,840
memory.

1695
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,840
So here's

1696
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:30,840
a question

1697
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:31,840
for you.

1698
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:32,840
As

1699
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:33,840
time increases,

1700
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:34,840
what do

1701
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:35,840
more and

1702
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:36,840
more threads

1703
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:37,840
do?

1704
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:38,840
Yeah?

1705
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:39,840
The

1706
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:40,840
idle?

1707
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,840
Yeah.

1708
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:42,840
Because

1709
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:43,840
they're not

1710
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:44,840
doing any

1711
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:45,840
work.

1712
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,840
If we

1713
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,840
come back

1714
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,840
and look at

1715
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:49,840
this,

1716
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:50,840
if we

1717
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:51,840
get to

1718
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,840
the last

1719
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:53,840
level,

1720
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,840
8 elements,

1721
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:55,840
even

1722
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,840
like in

1723
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,840
the first

1724
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:58,840
thing,

1725
00:47:58,840 --> 00:47:59,840
you're going

1726
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:00,840
to see

1727
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:01,840
four threads

1728
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,840
are not

1729
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:03,840
doing any

1730
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,840
addition at

1731
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,840
all.

1732
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,840
Only four

1733
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,840
threads are.

1734
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,840
In the

1735
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,840
next iteration,

1736
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:10,840
only two

1737
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,840
threads are.

1738
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,840
In the

1739
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:13,840
next iteration,

1740
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:14,840
only one

1741
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:15,840
thread is

1742
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,840
doing

1743
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:17,840
something.

1744
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:18,840
So what

1745
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:19,840
does that

1746
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:20,840
mean?

1747
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:21,840
In

1748
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,840
general,

1749
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:23,840
the number

1750
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:24,840
of threads

1751
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:25,840
you use is

1752
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,840
half.

1753
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:27,840
By the time

1754
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:28,840
you get to

1755
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,840
the last

1756
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:30,840
iteration,

1757
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,840
most of

1758
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:32,840
your threads

1759
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:33,840
are not

1760
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:34,840
tweaking.

1761
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,840
So what if

1762
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,840
we tweak

1763
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,840
this algorithm?

1764
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:38,840
And how

1765
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:39,840
should we

1766
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,840
tweak it?

1767
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,840
So we

1768
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:42,840
have,

1769
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:43,840
how should

1770
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:44,840
we tweak

1771
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:45,840
this algorithm

1772
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:46,840
to make

1773
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,840
it a little

1774
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:48,840
better?

1775
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:49,840
What's an

1776
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,840
alternate way

1777
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,840
to do

1778
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:52,840
that?

1779
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:53,840
The same

1780
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:54,840
algorithm.

1781
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:55,840
The same

1782
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:56,840
add two

1783
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,840
elements and

1784
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:58,840
so on.

1785
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,840
Right?

1786
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,840
Like,

1787
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:01,840
naively,

1788
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:02,840
right?

1789
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,840
Like,

1790
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,840
dense them

1791
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:05,840
all.

1792
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,840
So,

1793
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:07,840
like,

1794
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,840
instead of

1795
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:09,840
one and

1796
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:10,840
then idle

1797
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:11,840
five,

1798
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:12,840
idle nine,

1799
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:13,840
idle 18,

1800
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,840
put all

1801
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:15,840
those together

1802
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:16,840
and the

1803
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,840
next time it

1804
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:18,840
will be

1805
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:19,840
systems pointing

1806
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:20,840
at each

1807
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:21,840
other.

1808
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:22,840
I like your

1809
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:23,840
idea.

1810
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:24,840
Tell me

1811
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:25,840
what happens

1812
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,840
with the

1813
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:27,840
arrows.

1814
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:28,840
Arrows,

1815
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,840
fade.

1816
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,840
So let's

1817
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:31,840
say zero.

1818
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,840
Let's start

1819
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:33,840
from zero.

1820
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,840
What should

1821
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:35,840
we add to

1822
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:36,840
zero in

1823
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:37,840
your idea?

1824
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,840
We should

1825
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:39,840
add one.

1826
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:40,840
Okay.

1827
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:41,840
Then we

1828
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:42,840
should make

1829
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,840
two and

1830
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,840
what should

1831
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:45,840
we add to

1832
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:46,840
two?

1833
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:47,840
But we

1834
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:48,840
are doing

1835
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:49,840
the same

1836
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:50,840
thing.

1837
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:51,840
So what

1838
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:52,840
should we

1839
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:53,840
add to

1840
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:54,840
zero?

1841
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:55,840
You're

1842
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:56,840
saying bunch

1843
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:57,840
them

1844
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:58,840
up.

1845
00:49:58,840 --> 00:49:59,840
What if

1846
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,840
we did

1847
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:01,840
like,

1848
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:02,840
like,

1849
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:03,840
zero and

1850
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:04,840
seven?

1851
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:05,840
Zero and

1852
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:06,840
seven.

1853
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:07,840
Okay.

1854
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:08,840
And then

1855
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:09,840
like,

1856
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,840
one and

1857
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,840
six.

1858
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:12,840
Okay.

1859
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,840
And

1860
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:14,840
then

1861
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:15,840
one and

1862
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:16,840
six.

1863
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,840
Okay.

1864
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:18,840
And

1865
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:19,840
then five

1866
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:20,840
and four.

1867
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,840
I like

1868
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:22,840
that idea

1869
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:23,840
better.

1870
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:24,840
But flip

1871
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:25,840
it around.

1872
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,840
What if

1873
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:27,840
we do

1874
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,840
zero and

1875
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:29,840
four,

1876
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:30,840
one and

1877
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:31,840
five,

1878
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,840
two and

1879
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:33,840
six,

1880
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,840
three and

1881
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,840
seven?

1882
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:36,840
So let's

1883
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:37,840
take a look

1884
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,840
at that.

1885
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,840
So we

1886
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,840
have this,

1887
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,840
right?

1888
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:42,840
This is

1889
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:43,840
our input

1890
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,840
array.

1891
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,840
What if

1892
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:46,840
we do

1893
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:47,840
this?

1894
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:48,840
How

1895
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:49,840
about this

1896
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:50,840
now?

1897
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:51,840
What is

1898
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,840
this doing?

1899
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:53,840
Isolating

1900
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:54,840
the thread.

1901
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:55,840
You're

1902
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:56,840
isolating the

1903
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:57,840
thread.

1904
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:58,840
What's the

1905
00:50:58,840 --> 00:50:59,840
next step

1906
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:00,840
for me?

1907
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:01,840
So you

1908
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,840
take those

1909
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:03,840
two

1910
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:04,840
threads,

1911
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:05,840
right?

1912
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:06,840
And

1913
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,840
you

1914
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,840
take the

1915
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:09,840
next

1916
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,840
thread,

1917
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:11,840
right?

1918
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:12,840
And

1919
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,840
you

1920
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,840
isolate

1921
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:15,840
the

1922
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,840
next

1923
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:17,840
thread,

1924
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:18,840
right?

1925
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:19,840
So you

1926
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:20,840
take those

1927
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,840
two and

1928
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,840
add it.

1929
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:23,840
The last

1930
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:24,840
step is

1931
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:25,840
likely going

1932
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:26,840
to be the

1933
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:27,840
same.

1934
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:28,840
So now

1935
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:29,840
what that

1936
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:30,840
allows us

1937
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:31,840
to do is

1938
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,840
a few

1939
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,840
things.

1940
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,840
I want you

1941
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,840
to pay

1942
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,840
attention.

1943
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,840
I'll go

1944
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,840
back and

1945
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:39,840
show you

1946
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:40,840
one thing

1947
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:41,840
in our

1948
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,840
code that

1949
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:43,840
we have.

1950
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:44,840
So this

1951
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:45,840
is our

1952
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:46,840
thread.

1953
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:47,840
So

1954
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,840
I want you

1955
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:49,840
to pay

1956
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:50,840
attention.

1957
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:51,840
See how

1958
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,840
big this

1959
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:53,840
condition

1960
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:54,840
is.

1961
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:55,840
T

1962
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,840
modulo

1963
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:57,840
two times

1964
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:58,840
prime.

1965
00:51:58,840 --> 00:51:59,840
Where are

1966
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:00,840
we doing

1967
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:01,840
two times

1968
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,840
prime?

1969
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:03,840
We're

1970
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:04,840
doing it

1971
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:05,840
again.

1972
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:06,840
When we

1973
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:07,840
go up in

1974
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:08,840
the

1975
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,840
column,

1976
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,840
we're

1977
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,840
doing it

1978
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:12,840
again.

1979
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:13,840
We do

1980
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:14,840
it there

1981
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,840
and

1982
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,840
we're

1983
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:17,840
doing it

1984
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,840
again.

1985
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,840
Modulo

1986
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:20,840
is

1987
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:21,840
extremely

1988
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,840
bad.

1989
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,840
I can't

1990
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:24,840
tell you

1991
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,840
how bad

1992
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:26,840
it is.

1993
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:27,840
It is

1994
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:28,840
like

1995
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:29,840
compared

1996
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:30,840
to a

1997
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:31,840
floating

1998
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,840
point

1999
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:33,840
addition,

2000
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,840
it is

2001
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:35,840
probably

2002
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:36,840
20 to

2003
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:37,840
40 times

2004
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:38,840
lower than

2005
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:39,840
a

2006
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:40,840
multiplication

2007
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:41,840
because it

2008
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:42,840
is not in

2009
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:43,840
hardware.

2010
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:44,840
So

2011
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:45,840
remember

2012
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:46,840
those two.

2013
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:47,840
I will

2014
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:48,840
fast forward

2015
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:49,840
a little

2016
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:50,840
bit and

2017
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:51,840
see the

2018
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:52,840
code for

2019
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:53,840
this.

2020
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,840
So

2021
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:55,840
we are

2022
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:56,840
not changing

2023
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,840
any of

2024
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:58,840
that.

2025
00:52:58,840 --> 00:52:59,840
But now

2026
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:00,840
look at

2027
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:01,840
this.

2028
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:02,840
We start

2029
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:03,840
with

2030
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:04,840
this.

2031
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:05,840
So if

2032
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:06,840
we look

2033
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:07,840
at

2034
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:08,840
this

2035
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:09,840
example

2036
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:10,840
here,

2037
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:11,840
the smaller

2038
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:12,840
version,

2039
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:13,840
our

2040
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:14,840
stride in

2041
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:15,840
this case

2042
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,840
in the

2043
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:17,840
first level

2044
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:18,840
is 4.

2045
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:19,840
You go

2046
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:20,840
from 0

2047
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,840
to 4,

2048
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,840
1 to

2049
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,840
5,

2050
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:24,840
2 to

2051
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:25,840
6,

2052
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:26,840
3 to

2053
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:27,840
7,

2054
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:28,840
and

2055
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:29,840
stride is

2056
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:30,840
4.

2057
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:31,840
So we

2058
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:32,840
want the

2059
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:33,840
stride to

2060
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:34,840
go from

2061
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:35,840
4 to

2062
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:36,840
1.

2063
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:37,840
So we

2064
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:38,840
start

2065
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:39,840
there.

2066
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:40,840
Our

2067
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,840
condition is

2068
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:42,840
very simple.

2069
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:43,840
We

2070
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:44,840
have our

2071
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,840
same

2072
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,840
strides,

2073
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:47,840
but now

2074
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:48,840
look at

2075
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,840
this

2076
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:50,840
condition.

2077
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:51,840
So

2078
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:52,840
simple.

2079
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:53,840
T less

2080
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,840
than

2081
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:55,840
stride.

2082
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:56,840
We

2083
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:57,840
add.

2084
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:58,840
So now

2085
00:53:58,840 --> 00:53:59,840
this

2086
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:00,840
operation

2087
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:01,840
remains the

2088
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,840
same,

2089
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:03,840
but

2090
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,840
our

2091
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,840
condition is

2092
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:06,840
simpler.

2093
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:07,840
Our

2094
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:08,840
modular

2095
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:09,840
is lower

2096
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:10,840
and

2097
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:11,840
our

2098
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:12,840
stride is

2099
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:13,840
also

2100
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:14,840
simpler.

2101
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:15,840
So

2102
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,840
thinking

2103
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:17,840
we

2104
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:18,840
haven't

2105
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:19,840
even

2106
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:20,840
optimized it

2107
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:21,840
completely yet.

2108
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,840
We

2109
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:23,840
just went

2110
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:24,840
from

2111
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:25,840
addressing

2112
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,840
to

2113
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:27,840
stride

2114
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:28,840
addressing.

2115
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:29,840
And

2116
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:30,840
thinking

2117
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:31,840
about that

2118
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:32,840
will probably

2119
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,840
make our

2120
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:34,840
algorithm

2121
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:35,840
40%

2122
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:36,840
faster

2123
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:37,840
on a

2124
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:38,840
GPU.

2125
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:39,840
Any

2126
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:40,840
questions?

2127
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:41,840
So

2128
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:42,840
we

2129
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:43,840
actually

2130
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:44,840
haven't

2131
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:45,840
changed the

2132
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,840
number of

2133
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,840
threads we

2134
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,840
launched yet.

2135
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,840
We will get

2136
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:50,840
to that.

2137
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:51,840
But in

2138
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:52,840
this we

2139
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:53,840
haven't changed

2140
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:54,840
it.

2141
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:55,840
So if I go

2142
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:56,840
back there, we

2143
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:57,840
still launch

2144
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:58,840
eight threads.

2145
00:54:58,840 --> 00:54:59,840
And

2146
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:00,840
eight threads

2147
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,840
load eight

2148
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,840
values into

2149
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:03,840
ShedMap.

2150
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:04,840
But when

2151
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:05,840
you get to

2152
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,840
the addition

2153
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:07,840
part, you

2154
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,840
will see

2155
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:09,840
how to

2156
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:10,840
optimize

2157
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:11,840
that.

2158
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:12,840
Any

2159
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:13,840
other

2160
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,840
questions on

2161
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:15,840
this?

2162
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:16,840
So

2163
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:17,840
next

2164
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:18,840
Wednesday we

2165
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:19,840
are going

2166
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:20,840
to have

2167
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,840
what I

2168
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:22,840
essentially

2169
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:23,840
call

2170
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:24,840
next

2171
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:25,840
Wednesday's

2172
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:26,840
presentation.

2173
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:27,840
At some

2174
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:28,840
point on

2175
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:29,840
the calendar

2176
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:30,840
I forget

2177
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:31,840
the exact

2178
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:32,840
date, we

2179
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:33,840
will have

2180
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,840
what I

2181
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,840
call

2182
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:36,840
performance

2183
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:37,840
optimization.

2184
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:38,840
I will

2185
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:39,840
run all

2186
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:40,840
of this

2187
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,840
code.

2188
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:42,840
I will

2189
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,840
run this

2190
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,840
version and

2191
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:45,840
we will see

2192
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:46,840
with each

2193
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:47,840
version how

2194
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:48,840
much it

2195
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,840
improved.

2196
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,840
I will send

2197
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:51,840
out instructions

2198
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:52,840
for you to

2199
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:53,840
bring your

2200
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:54,840
laptops to

2201
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,840
class and

2202
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:56,840
you can run

2203
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:57,840
it with

2204
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:58,840
me.

2205
00:55:58,840 --> 00:55:59,840
We will

2206
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:00,840
see how

2207
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:01,840
much better

2208
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:02,840
it gets

2209
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:03,840
with simple

2210
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:04,840
modifications

2211
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,840
like this.

2212
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:06,840
Okay.

2213
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:07,840
So

2214
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:08,840
visually,

2215
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:09,840
what is this

2216
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:10,840
going to

2217
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:11,840
do?

2218
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:12,840
What happens

2219
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:13,840
in iteration

2220
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:14,840
1?

2221
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:15,840
What happens

2222
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:16,840
in iteration

2223
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:17,840
1 to

2224
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:18,840
our threads?

2225
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:19,840
Which threads

2226
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:20,840
are going to

2227
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:21,840
do the

2228
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:22,840
work and

2229
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:23,840
which threads

2230
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:24,840
are not?

2231
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:25,840
So before

2232
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:26,840
iteration 1

2233
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:27,840
they are all

2234
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:28,840
doing work

2235
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,840
by loading

2236
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:30,840
things into

2237
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:31,840
memory.

2238
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:32,840
At iteration

2239
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:33,840
1 only

2240
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:34,840
four threads

2241
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:35,840
are doing

2242
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:36,840
the work.

2243
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:37,840
So four threads

2244
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:38,840
are already

2245
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:39,840
kind of useless.

2246
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:40,840
Then in

2247
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:41,840
iteration 2,

2248
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:42,840
two more

2249
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:43,840
threads are

2250
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:44,840
doing the

2251
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:45,840
work.

2252
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:46,840
Iteration 3,

2253
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,840
only one

2254
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:48,840
thread is

2255
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:49,840
actually doing

2256
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:50,840
anything.

2257
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:51,840
So now

2258
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,840
if you look

2259
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:53,840
at this

2260
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:54,840
side by

2261
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:55,840
side,

2262
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:56,840
again,

2263
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:57,840
I told

2264
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:58,840
side by

2265
00:56:58,840 --> 00:56:59,840
side is

2266
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,840
good,

2267
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:01,840
I am

2268
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:02,840
using

2269
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:03,840
side by

2270
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:04,840
side.

2271
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,840
And

2272
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:06,840
we have

2273
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,840
spoken about

2274
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,840
all of

2275
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:09,840
this.

2276
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:10,840
So I

2277
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:11,840
just want

2278
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:12,840
to make

2279
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:13,840
sure the

2280
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:14,840
memory is

2281
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:15,840
all there

2282
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:16,840
for all

2283
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,840
of you.

2284
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:18,840
Indexing is

2285
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:19,840
cleaner.

2286
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:20,840
The other

2287
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:21,840
thing we

2288
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:22,840
haven't spoken

2289
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:23,840
about yet

2290
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:24,840
is memory

2291
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:25,840
coalescing.

2292
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:26,840
You are

2293
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:27,840
reading

2294
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:28,840
continuous

2295
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:29,840
values here.

2296
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:30,840
These four

2297
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:31,840
read the

2298
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:32,840
same value

2299
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:33,840
here.

2300
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:34,840
The

2301
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:35,840
for loop

2302
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:36,840
is simpler.

2303
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:37,840
Lots of

2304
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:38,840
benefits.

2305
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:39,840
If you look

2306
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:40,840
at the

2307
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:41,840
code,

2308
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:42,840
I have

2309
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,840
highlighted

2310
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:44,840
this already,

2311
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:45,840
but this

2312
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:46,840
if statement

2313
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:47,840
is so much

2314
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:48,840
simpler than

2315
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,840
this.

2316
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:50,840
If we

2317
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:51,840
just make

2318
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:52,840
this change

2319
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:53,840
on a

2320
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:54,840
GPU

2321
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:55,840
algorithm,

2322
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:56,840
let's say

2323
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:57,840
for 10

2324
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:58,840
million elements,

2325
00:57:58,840 --> 00:57:59,840
we are

2326
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:00,840
probably going

2327
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:01,840
to see

2328
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,840
this.

2329
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:03,840
That's

2330
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:04,840
how much

2331
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:05,840
overhead that

2332
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:06,840
kind of

2333
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:07,840
condition has

2334
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:08,840
every single

2335
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:09,840
time you do

2336
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:10,840
it.

2337
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:11,840
Any other

2338
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:12,840
questions so

2339
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:13,840
far?

2340
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:14,840
This is

2341
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:15,840
value reduction

2342
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:16,840
revisited.

2343
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:17,840
Any other

2344
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:18,840
questions?

2345
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:20,840
Is there

2346
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:21,840
any way

2347
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:22,840
to

2348
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:23,840
reuse

2349
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:24,840
that?

2350
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:25,840
Not in

2351
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:26,840
this

2352
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:27,840
algorithm,

2353
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:28,840
but in a

2354
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:29,840
moment I'm

2355
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:30,840
going to

2356
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,840
get to

2357
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:32,840
why you

2358
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:33,840
may actually

2359
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:34,840
want them

2360
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:35,840
to become

2361
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:36,840
useless.

2362
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:37,840
If they

2363
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:38,840
become useless

2364
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:39,840
like this

2365
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:40,840
left side,

2366
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:41,840
that's not

2367
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:42,840
good because

2368
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:43,840
now you are

2369
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:44,840
wasting time.

2370
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:45,840
Whereas

2371
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:46,840
here it

2372
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:47,840
could be

2373
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,840
strategically

2374
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:49,840
valuable.

2375
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:50,840
Yeah,

2376
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:51,840
absolutely.

2377
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:52,840
For

2378
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:53,840
example,

2379
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:54,840
if you

2380
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:55,840
were launching

2381
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:56,840
only half

2382
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:57,840
of the

2383
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:58,840
threads,

2384
00:58:58,840 --> 00:58:59,840
it would

2385
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:00,840
still work

2386
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:01,840
the same.

2387
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,840
You would

2388
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:03,840
just have

2389
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:04,840
to load

2390
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:05,840
memory twice

2391
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:06,840
for each

2392
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:07,840
thread.

2393
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:08,840
Also,

2394
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:09,840
if you

2395
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:10,840
are still

2396
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:11,840
trying to

2397
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:12,840
make the

2398
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:13,840
first four

2399
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:14,840
threads,

2400
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:15,840
then can't

2401
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:16,840
you just

2402
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:17,840
add

2403
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:18,840
offsets

2404
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:19,840
to each

2405
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:20,840
thread?

2406
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:21,840
So it's

2407
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:22,840
not like

2408
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:23,840
the interleaving

2409
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:24,840
threads are

2410
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:25,840
useless,

2411
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:26,840
but the

2412
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:27,840
calculation

2413
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:28,840
is still

2414
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:29,840
that one,

2415
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:30,840
but you are

2416
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:31,840
just adding

2417
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:32,840
offsets to

2418
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:33,840
each.

2419
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:34,840
Wouldn't

2420
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:35,840
that be

2421
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:36,840
the same

2422
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:37,840
as this?

2423
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:38,840
Wouldn't

2424
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:39,840
that be

2425
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:40,840
the same

2426
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:41,840
as this?

2427
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:42,840
Yeah,

2428
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:43,840
in my

2429
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:44,840
mind it was

2430
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:45,840
the same

2431
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:46,840
as this.

2432
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:47,840
So if

2433
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:48,840
you are

2434
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:49,840
making the

2435
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:50,840
offset block

2436
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:51,840
them by

2437
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:52,840
two,

2438
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:53,840
you are

2439
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:54,840
suggesting

2440
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:55,840
why don't

2441
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:56,840
we just

2442
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:57,840
make it

2443
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:58,840
16 at

2444
00:59:58,840 --> 00:59:59,840
a time

2445
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:00,840
and it

2446
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:01,840
would still

2447
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:02,840
be

2448
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:03,840
interleaved

2449
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:04,840
and then

2450
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:05,840
we would

2451
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:06,840
add them

2452
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:07,840
up.

2453
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:08,840
Yeah,

2454
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:09,840
the addition

2455
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,840
is still

2456
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:11,840
interleaved

2457
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:12,840
instead of

2458
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:13,840
doing it

2459
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:14,840
this way

2460
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:15,840
.

2461
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:16,840
Is there

2462
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:17,840
any reason

2463
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:18,840
why you are

2464
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:19,840
saying this

2465
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:20,840
kind of

2466
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:21,840
addition?

2467
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:22,840
Yeah,

2468
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:23,840
and that's

2469
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:24,840
the key

2470
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:25,840
point.

2471
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:26,840
If we are

2472
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:27,840
drawing a

2473
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:28,840
tree,

2474
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:29,840
we are

2475
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:30,840
not going

2476
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:31,840
to draw

2477
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:32,840
it like that,

2478
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:33,840
but the

2479
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:34,840
amount of

2480
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:35,840
computation

2481
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:36,840
that happens

2482
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:37,840
is exactly

2483
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:38,840
the same.

2484
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:39,840
Here you

2485
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:40,840
are probably

2486
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:41,840
doing index

2487
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:42,840
plus one,

2488
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:43,840
index plus

2489
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,840
two,

2490
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:45,840
and you

2491
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:46,840
are doing

2492
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:47,840
it as a

2493
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:48,840
simple

2494
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:49,840
condition.

2495
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:50,840
Any other

2496
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:51,840
questions on

2497
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:52,840
value

2498
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:53,840
deductions so

2499
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:54,840
far?

2500
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:55,840
So let's

2501
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:56,840
take it a

2502
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:57,840
step further

2503
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:58,840
and look at

2504
01:00:58,840 --> 01:00:59,840
warp partitioning.

2505
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:00,840
Warp

2506
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:01,840
partitioning

2507
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:02,840
is how

2508
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:03,840
strands

2509
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:04,840
from a

2510
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:05,840
block

2511
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:06,840
are

2512
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:07,840
divided into

2513
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:08,840
warps.

2514
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:09,840
So we

2515
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:10,840
said if

2516
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:11,840
we go back

2517
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:12,840
to warps

2518
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:13,840
five years

2519
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:14,840
ago, we

2520
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:15,840
said that

2521
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:16,840
block size

2522
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:17,840
is defined

2523
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,840
by U,

2524
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:19,840
and then

2525
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:20,840
the threads

2526
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:21,840
in a

2527
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:22,840
block are

2528
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:23,840
subdivided

2529
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:24,840
into warps

2530
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:25,840
at the

2531
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:26,840
hardware level.

2532
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:27,840
You don't

2533
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:28,840
control that.

2534
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:29,840
Each warp

2535
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:30,840
has 32

2536
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:31,840
threads,

2537
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:32,840
and that's

2538
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:33,840
divided at

2539
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:34,840
the hardware

2540
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:35,840
level.

2541
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:36,840
Warp

2542
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:37,840
partitioning

2543
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:38,840
is about

2544
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:39,840
how you

2545
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:40,840
use the

2546
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:41,840
threads in

2547
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:42,840
a

2548
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:43,840
warp.

2549
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:44,840
You can

2550
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:45,840
strategically

2551
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:46,840
define your

2552
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:47,840
algorithm so

2553
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:48,840
that it's

2554
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:49,840
taking

2555
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:50,840
advantage of

2556
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:51,840
that.

2557
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:52,840
So there

2558
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:53,840
are two

2559
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:54,840
things that

2560
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:55,840
we'll cover

2561
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:56,840
today.

2562
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:57,840
Minimizing

2563
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:58,840
branch

2564
01:01:58,840 --> 01:01:59,840
divergence.

2565
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:00,840
Why do

2566
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:01,840
we want to

2567
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:02,840
minimize

2568
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:03,840
branch

2569
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:04,840
divergence

2570
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:05,840
within a

2571
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:06,840
warp?

2572
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:07,840
Why do

2573
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:08,840
we want to

2574
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:09,840
minimize

2575
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:10,840
branch

2576
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:11,840
divergence

2577
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:12,840
within a

2578
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:13,840
warp?

2579
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:14,840
If you have

2580
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:15,840
branch

2581
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:16,840
divergence

2582
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:17,840
within a

2583
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:18,840
warp,

2584
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:19,840
you're going

2585
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:20,840
to do

2586
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:21,840
double the

2587
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:22,840
warp.

2588
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:23,840
In

2589
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:24,840
worst case

2590
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:25,840
you're doing

2591
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:26,840
n times

2592
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:27,840
the warp,

2593
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:28,840
even though

2594
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:29,840
you're not

2595
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:30,840
actually doing

2596
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:31,840
that.

2597
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:32,840
So you

2598
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:33,840
want to

2599
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:34,840
do that

2600
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:35,840
and you

2601
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:36,840
want to

2602
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:37,840
retire

2603
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:38,840
warp

2604
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:39,840
partitioning

2605
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:40,840
within

2606
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,840
a

2607
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:42,840
warp.

2608
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:43,840
Let's

2609
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:44,840
take a look

2610
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:45,840
at examples

2611
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:46,840
of how

2612
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:47,840
warps are

2613
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:48,840
structured.

2614
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:49,840
In a

2615
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:50,840
1D

2616
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:51,840
block,

2617
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:52,840
1024 is

2618
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:53,840
the maximum

2619
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:54,840
block size

2620
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:55,840
you can

2621
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:56,840
have.

2622
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:57,840
And

2623
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:58,840
warp n

2624
01:02:58,840 --> 01:02:59,840
will start

2625
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:00,840
at 32n

2626
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:01,840
and end

2627
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:02,840
at 32n

2628
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:03,840
plus 1

2629
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:04,840
minus 1.

2630
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:05,840
Very

2631
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:06,840
simple,

2632
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:07,840
very

2633
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:08,840
straightforward.

2634
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:09,840
So

2635
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:10,840
1D

2636
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:11,840
warp

2637
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:12,840
structure.

2638
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:13,840
No

2639
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:14,840
questions?

2640
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:15,840
Okay.

2641
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:16,840
So let's

2642
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:17,840
look at a

2643
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:18,840
2D

2644
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:19,840
block.

2645
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:20,840
So in

2646
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:21,840
a 2D

2647
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:22,840
block,

2648
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:23,840
increasing

2649
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:24,840
thread

2650
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:25,840
IDX means

2651
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:26,840
increasing

2652
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:27,840
thread IDX

2653
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:28,840
dot X

2654
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:29,840
plus and

2655
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:30,840
start with

2656
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:31,840
thread IDX

2657
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:32,840
dot Y

2658
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:33,840
equals 0.

2659
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:34,840
And only

2660
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:35,840
when you

2661
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:36,840
hit the

2662
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:37,840
maximum

2663
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:38,840
of X

2664
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:39,840
you

2665
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:40,840
get

2666
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:41,840
32 to

2667
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:42,840
63 in

2668
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:43,840
X

2669
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:44,840
and still

2670
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:45,840
0 in

2671
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:46,840
Y.

2672
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:47,840
But at

2673
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:48,840
63 you

2674
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:49,840
hit the

2675
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:50,840
maximum

2676
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:51,840
of X.

2677
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:52,840
So in

2678
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:53,840
warp 2,

2679
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:54,840
X resets

2680
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:55,840
to go

2681
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:56,840
0 to

2682
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:57,840
31 and

2683
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:58,840
Y increases.

2684
01:03:58,840 --> 01:03:59,840
Then you

2685
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:00,840
go to

2686
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:01,840
warp 3 and

2687
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:02,840
it's 32

2688
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:03,840
63 on

2689
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:04,840
X and

2690
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:05,840
warp Y

2691
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:06,840
is the

2692
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:07,840
maximum

2693
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:08,840
of X.

2694
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:09,840
What

2695
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:10,840
happens in

2696
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:11,840
warp 4?

2697
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:12,840
Y increases,

2698
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:13,840
X resets.

2699
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:14,840
Okay?

2700
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:15,840
So these

2701
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:16,840
threads in

2702
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:17,840
a warp will

2703
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:18,840
always be

2704
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:19,840
continuous.

2705
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:20,840
Okay?

2706
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:21,840
Any

2707
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:22,840
questions on

2708
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:23,840
this?

2709
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:24,840
So if

2710
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:25,840
you have a

2711
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:26,840
block of

2712
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:27,840
64 by

2713
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:28,840
8, how

2714
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:29,840
many warps

2715
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:30,840
are we

2716
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:31,840
getting?

2717
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:32,840
16.

2718
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:33,840
All

2719
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:34,840
right.

2720
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:35,840
The other

2721
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:36,840
thing to

2722
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:37,840
pay attention

2723
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:38,840
to is

2724
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:39,840
essentially

2725
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:40,840
how we

2726
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:41,840
got from

2727
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:42,840
here to

2728
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:43,840
here.

2729
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:44,840
Just remember

2730
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:45,840
that.

2731
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:46,840
In a 3D

2732
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:47,840
block you do

2733
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:48,840
the exact

2734
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:49,840
same thing

2735
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,840
as we did

2736
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:51,840
with 2D

2737
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:52,840
but now

2738
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:53,840
you have a

2739
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:54,840
Z component.

2740
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:55,840
You will

2741
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:56,840
rarely use

2742
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:57,840
3D blocks.

2743
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:58,840
I certainly

2744
01:04:58,840 --> 01:04:59,840
don't recommend

2745
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:00,840
it.

2746
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:01,840
But if

2747
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:02,840
you ever do,

2748
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:03,840
that's how

2749
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:04,840
it will

2750
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:05,840
work.

2751
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:06,840
You will

2752
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:07,840
be doing

2753
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:08,840
double the

2754
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:09,840
work.

2755
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:10,840
If not

2756
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:11,840
N times

2757
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:12,840
the work

2758
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:13,840
based on

2759
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:14,840
how your

2760
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:15,840
branches

2761
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:16,840
diverge.

2762
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:17,840
Branch

2763
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:18,840
divergence

2764
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:19,840
within a

2765
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:20,840
block is

2766
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:21,840
bad.

2767
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:22,840
You don't

2768
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:23,840
want branches

2769
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:24,840
to diverge

2770
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:25,840
within a

2771
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:26,840
block.

2772
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:27,840
Not

2773
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:28,840
entirely

2774
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:29,840
true.

2775
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:30,840
Ideally,

2776
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:31,840
yes.

2777
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:32,840
But it

2778
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:33,840
is probably

2779
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:34,840
not okay

2780
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:35,840
for a

2781
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:36,840
branch in

2782
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:37,840
a block.

2783
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:38,840
So let's

2784
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:39,840
take a look

2785
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:40,840
at an

2786
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:41,840
example.

2787
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:42,840
So for

2788
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:43,840
what size

2789
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:44,840
people

2790
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:45,840
certainly

2791
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:46,840
do,

2792
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:47,840
which

2793
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:48,840
works have

2794
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:49,840
divergence

2795
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:50,840
or does

2796
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:51,840
any work

2797
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:52,840
have

2798
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:53,840
divergence

2799
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:54,840
for this

2800
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:55,840
condition?

2801
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:56,840
The first

2802
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:57,840
work,

2803
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:58,840
okay.

2804
01:05:58,840 --> 01:05:59,840
What

2805
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:00,840
else?

2806
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:01,840
Or no

2807
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:02,840
other

2808
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:03,840
work?

2809
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:04,840
Divergence?

2810
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:05,840
So it

2811
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:06,840
depends.

2812
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:07,840
Let me

2813
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:08,840
come back

2814
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:09,840
to you.

2815
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:10,840
Exactly.

2816
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:11,840
Remember

2817
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:12,840
our 2D

2818
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:13,840
work, how

2819
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:14,840
y increases

2820
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:15,840
and x

2821
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:16,840
resets?

2822
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:17,840
Every time

2823
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:18,840
thread

2824
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:19,840
IDH.x,

2825
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:20,840
any book

2826
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:21,840
that has

2827
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:22,840
thread

2828
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:23,840
IDH.x in

2829
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:24,840
this book

2830
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:25,840
will

2831
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:26,840
have

2832
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:27,840
2D

2833
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:28,840
work.

2834
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:29,840
So

2835
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:30,840
2D

2836
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:31,840
works

2837
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:32,840
in

2838
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:33,840
this

2839
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:34,840
condition,

2840
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:35,840
you will

2841
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:36,840
have a

2842
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:37,840
branch

2843
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:38,840
divergence.

2844
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:39,840
It's not

2845
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:40,840
just the

2846
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:41,840
first work.

2847
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:42,840
It is

2848
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:43,840
any work

2849
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:44,840
that has

2850
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:45,840
this

2851
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:46,840
condition.

2852
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:47,840
Okay?

2853
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:48,840
What

2854
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:49,840
about

2855
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:50,840
this?

2856
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:51,840
Does

2857
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:52,840
this

2858
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:53,840
diverge?

2859
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:54,840
You're

2860
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:55,840
not

2861
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:56,840
shaking

2862
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:57,840
your head.

2863
01:06:57,840 --> 01:06:58,840
Why

2864
01:06:58,840 --> 01:06:59,840
does this

2865
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:00,840
work?

2866
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:01,840
This

2867
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:02,840
will

2868
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:03,840
never be

2869
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:04,840
true.

2870
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:05,840
Like,

2871
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:06,840
it may

2872
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:07,840
be true,

2873
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:08,840
so in

2874
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:09,840
the first

2875
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:10,840
work,

2876
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:11,840
let's

2877
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:12,840
take 1D

2878
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:13,840
example.

2879
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:14,840
In the

2880
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:15,840
first work,

2881
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:16,840
0 to

2882
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:17,840
31.

2883
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:18,840
Work

2884
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:19,840
sizes,

2885
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:20,840
32.

2886
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:21,840
Minus

2887
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:22,840
1 is

2888
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:23,840
31.

2889
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:24,840
Can

2890
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:25,840
any value

2891
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:26,840
between 0

2892
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:27,840
and 31

2893
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:28,840
be greater

2894
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:29,840
than 31?

2895
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:30,840
In work

2896
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:31,840
0,

2897
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:32,840
it's not

2898
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:33,840
divergent.

2899
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,840
Let's go

2900
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:35,840
to work

2901
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:36,840
1.

2902
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:37,840
What are

2903
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:38,840
the values

2904
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:39,840
in work

2905
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:40,840
1 in

2906
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:41,840
a 1D

2907
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:42,840
case?

2908
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:43,840
32 to

2909
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:44,840
64.

2910
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:45,840
Now what

2911
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:46,840
happens?

2912
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:47,840
32 to

2913
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:48,840
64,

2914
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:49,840
greater than

2915
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:50,840
31.

2916
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:51,840
All

2917
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:52,840
true.

2918
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:53,840
No

2919
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:54,840
divergence.

2920
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:55,840
There's a

2921
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:56,840
diff condition,

2922
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:57,840
but no

2923
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:58,840
divergence.

2924
01:07:58,840 --> 01:07:59,840
No branch

2925
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:00,840
divergence

2926
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:01,840
here.

2927
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:02,840
Now let's

2928
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:03,840
say,

2929
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:04,840
let's say

2930
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:05,840
I have

2931
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:06,840
this.

2932
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:07,840
What

2933
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:08,840
happens now?

2934
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:09,840
So,

2935
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:10,840
work

2936
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:11,840
0,

2937
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:12,840
there won't

2938
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:13,840
be divergence.

2939
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:14,840
Okay?

2940
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:15,840
In work

2941
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:16,840
0,

2942
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:17,840
you go from

2943
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:18,840
0 to

2944
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:19,840
31,

2945
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:20,840
greater than

2946
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:21,840
32.

2947
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:22,840
Right?

2948
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:23,840
All false,

2949
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:24,840
it's fine.

2950
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:25,840
In work

2951
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:26,840
1,

2952
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:27,840
what happens?

2953
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:28,840
32 to

2954
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:29,840
64,

2955
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:30,840
compared to

2956
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:31,840
greater than

2957
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:32,840
31.

2958
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:33,840
Not greater than

2959
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:34,840
equals,

2960
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:35,840
greater than

2961
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:36,840
31.

2962
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:37,840
Is there

2963
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:38,840
divergence now?

2964
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:39,840
Yes,

2965
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:40,840
on the first

2966
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:41,840
thread,

2967
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:42,840
there is

2968
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:43,840
divergence.

2969
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:44,840
So you

2970
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:45,840
want to be

2971
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:46,840
paying attention

2972
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:47,840
to that.

2973
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:48,840
Those

2974
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:49,840
things matter,

2975
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:50,840
plus 1,

2976
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:51,840
minus 1,

2977
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:52,840
always

2978
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:53,840
matters.

2979
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:54,840
So now,

2980
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:55,840
given what

2981
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:56,840
we know

2982
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:57,840
about

2983
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:58,840
divergence,

2984
01:08:58,840 --> 01:08:59,840
let's take

2985
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:00,840
it visually.

2986
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:01,840
So pretend

2987
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:02,840
our work

2988
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:03,840
size is 2.

2989
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:04,840
Okay?

2990
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:05,840
What can we

2991
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:06,840
say about

2992
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:07,840
this?

2993
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:08,840
What can

2994
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:09,840
we say

2995
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:10,840
about the

2996
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:11,840
left and

2997
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:12,840
the right?

2998
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:13,840
How many

2999
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:14,840
diverging

3000
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:15,840
works do

3001
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:16,840
we have?

3002
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:17,840
On the

3003
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:18,840
left,

3004
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:19,840
4,

3005
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:20,840
and on

3006
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:21,840
the right,

3007
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:22,840
1.

3008
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:23,840
On the

3009
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:24,840
4,

3010
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:25,840
we have

3011
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:26,840
4.

3012
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:27,840
On the

3013
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:28,840
left,

3014
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:29,840
we have

3015
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:30,840
4.

3016
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:31,840
On the

3017
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:32,840
right,

3018
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:33,840
we have

3019
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:34,840
0.

3020
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:35,840
No branches

3021
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:36,840
diverge.

3022
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:37,840
Second

3023
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:38,840
pass,

3024
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:39,840
we have

3025
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:40,840
two branches

3026
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:41,840
diverging

3027
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:42,840
here.

3028
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:43,840
0 on

3029
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:44,840
the right.

3030
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:45,840
And on

3031
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:46,840
the last

3032
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:47,840
one,

3033
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:48,840
how many

3034
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:49,840
will we

3035
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:50,840
have?

3036
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:51,840
One on

3037
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:52,840
the left,

3038
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:53,840
one on

3039
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:54,840
the right.

3040
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:55,840
There is

3041
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:56,840
no other

3042
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:57,840
way around

3043
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:58,840
it.

3044
01:09:58,840 --> 01:09:59,840
But what

3045
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:00,840
we've

3046
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:01,840
essentially

3047
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:02,840
done is

3048
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:03,840
minimized

3049
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:04,840
how many

3050
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:05,840
divergent

3051
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:06,840
works we

3052
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:07,840
have.

3053
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:08,840
So if

3054
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:09,840
we take a

3055
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:10,840
look at

3056
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:11,840
this once

3057
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:12,840
again,

3058
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:13,840
what we

3059
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:14,840
also get

3060
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:15,840
from this

3061
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:16,840
is not

3062
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:17,840
just less

3063
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:18,840
diverging,

3064
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:19,840
but we

3065
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:20,840
can also

3066
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:21,840
get shorter

3067
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:22,840
time.

3068
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:23,840
So let's

3069
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:24,840
take a look

3070
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:25,840
at this.

3071
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:26,840
We can

3072
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:27,840
pretend a

3073
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:28,840
warp size

3074
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:29,840
is 2.

3075
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:30,840
In this

3076
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:31,840
case,

3077
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:32,840
no warps

3078
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:33,840
are there

3079
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:34,840
because all

3080
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:35,840
the warps

3081
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:36,840
are doing

3082
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:37,840
something or

3083
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:38,840
sticking around.

3084
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:39,840
Or at

3085
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:40,840
least one

3086
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:41,840
thread in

3087
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:42,840
the warp

3088
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:43,840
is doing

3089
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:44,840
something.

3090
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:45,840
So this

3091
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:46,840
thread,

3092
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:47,840
this thread,

3093
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:48,840
this thread

3094
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:49,840
is doing

3095
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:50,840
something.

3096
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:51,840
So you

3097
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:52,840
can't

3098
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:53,840
get rid

3099
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:54,840
of

3100
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:55,840
this.

3101
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:56,840
You

3102
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:57,840
can get

3103
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:58,840
rid of

3104
01:10:58,840 --> 01:10:59,840
this.

3105
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:00,840
So the

3106
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:01,840
scheduler can

3107
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:02,840
get rid

3108
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:03,840
of this.

3109
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:04,840
The

3110
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:05,840
scheduler can

3111
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:06,840
be like,

3112
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:07,840
okay,

3113
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:08,840
you have

3114
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:09,840
no more

3115
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:10,840
useful

3116
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:11,840
code to

3117
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:12,840
execute,

3118
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:13,840
bye-bye,

3119
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:14,840
return,

3120
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:15,840
that's it.

3121
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:16,840
And just

3122
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:17,840
these two

3123
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:18,840
warps will

3124
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:19,840
actually do

3125
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:20,840
work,

3126
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:21,840
which is

3127
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:22,840
good.

3128
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:23,840
But

3129
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:24,840
once the

3130
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:25,840
waiting will

3131
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:26,840
come and

3132
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:27,840
fill it up

3133
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:28,840
in the

3134
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:29,840
code,

3135
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:30,840
in the

3136
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:31,840
hardware,

3137
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:32,840
they will

3138
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:33,840
actually do

3139
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:34,840
something instead

3140
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:35,840
of making

3141
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:36,840
half the

3142
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:37,840
threads wait

3143
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:38,840
like there

3144
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:39,840
is here.

3145
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:40,840
Does

3146
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:41,840
everybody get

3147
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:42,840
that?

3148
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:43,840
Okay?

3149
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:44,840
In the

3150
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:45,840
next step,

3151
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:46,840
now we

3152
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:47,840
see two

3153
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:48,840
warps

3154
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:49,840
retired because

3155
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:50,840
these two

3156
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:51,840
are

3157
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:52,840
working.

3158
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:53,840
And then

3159
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:54,840
in the

3160
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:55,840
final step,

3161
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:56,840
yeah,

3162
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:57,840
no warps are

3163
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:58,840
retired,

3164
01:11:58,840 --> 01:11:59,840
but now

3165
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:00,840
the third

3166
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:01,840
warp is

3167
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:02,840
here.

3168
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:03,840
So

3169
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:04,840
after a

3170
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:05,840
full

3171
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:06,840
iteration.

3172
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:07,840
Okay?

3173
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:08,840
So

3174
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:09,840
everybody

3175
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:10,840
clear on

3176
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:11,840
how this

3177
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:12,840
works,

3178
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:13,840
how

3179
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:14,840
changing

3180
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:15,840
our

3181
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:16,840
indexing

3182
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:17,840
system is

3183
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:18,840
helping

3184
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:19,840
warps

3185
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:20,840
retire.

3186
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:21,840
In this

3187
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:22,840
case,

3188
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:23,840
in our

3189
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:24,840
right case

3190
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:25,840
where the

3191
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:26,840
warps are

3192
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:27,840
retiring,

3193
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:28,840
the same

3194
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:29,840
block or

3195
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:30,840
other block

3196
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:31,840
can fill

3197
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:32,840
it up.

3198
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:33,840
Whereas in

3199
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:34,840
this,

3200
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:35,840
even though

3201
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:36,840
you're using

3202
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:37,840
the same

3203
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:38,840
number of

3204
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:39,840
threads,

3205
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:40,840
the number

3206
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:41,840
of individual

3207
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:42,840
threads doesn't

3208
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:43,840
change.

3209
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:44,840
Remember

3210
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:45,840
that.

3211
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:46,840
But the

3212
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:47,840
number of

3213
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:48,840
threads and

3214
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:49,840
individual

3215
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:50,840
threads

3216
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:51,840
doesn't

3217
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:52,840
change.

3218
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:53,840
So

3219
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:54,840
essentially

3220
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:55,840
construct your

3221
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:56,840
algorithms.

3222
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:57,840
When you're

3223
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:58,840
thinking about

3224
01:12:58,840 --> 01:12:59,840
your

3225
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:00,840
algorithms,

3226
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:01,840
you always

3227
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:02,840
want to

3228
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:03,840
think about

3229
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:04,840
what is

3230
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:05,840
easy versus

3231
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:06,840
how the

3232
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:07,840
GPU and

3233
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:08,840
even your

3234
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:09,840
CPU is

3235
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:10,840
going to be

3236
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:11,840
using that.

3237
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:12,840
You always

3238
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:13,840
want to keep

3239
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:14,840
that in

3240
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:15,840
mind.

3241
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:16,840
What is

3242
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:17,840
the easy

3243
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:18,840
versus how

3244
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:19,840
the GPU and

3245
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:20,840
even your

3246
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:21,840
CPU is

3247
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:22,840
going to be

3248
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:23,840
using that.

3249
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:24,840
Questions

3250
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:25,840
around warp

3251
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:26,840
partition?

3252
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:27,840
Yeah.

3253
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:28,840
Right.

3254
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:29,840
So what

3255
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:30,840
you said,

3256
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:31,840
I'll put it

3257
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:32,840
in another

3258
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:33,840
way.

3259
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:34,840
When you

3260
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:35,840
retire warp,

3261
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:36,840
you're retiring

3262
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:37,840
threads.

3263
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:38,840
Okay?

3264
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:39,840
You're retiring

3265
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:40,840
their context.

3266
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:41,840
You're retiring

3267
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:42,840
their memory.

3268
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:43,840
So you're

3269
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:44,840
freeing up

3270
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:45,840
hardware

3271
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:46,840
resources.

3272
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:47,840
So what

3273
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:48,840
happens is

3274
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:49,840
there are

3275
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:50,840
blocks waiting.

3276
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:51,840
So let's

3277
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:52,840
say you

3278
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:53,840
launch 10

3279
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:54,840
million elements.

3280
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:55,840
You can't

3281
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:56,840
fit 10

3282
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:57,840
million elements

3283
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:58,840
on 4,000

3284
01:13:58,840 --> 01:13:59,840
ports,

3285
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:00,840
right?

3286
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:01,840
So when

3287
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:02,840
you retire

3288
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:03,840
those

3289
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:04,840
warps,

3290
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:05,840
those ports

3291
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:06,840
free up

3292
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:07,840
and new

3293
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:08,840
threads will

3294
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:09,840
fill them in.

3295
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:10,840
So it's

3296
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:11,840
not like

3297
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:12,840
you're using

3298
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:13,840
the same

3299
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:14,840
threads.

3300
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:15,840
You have

3301
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:16,840
the hardware

3302
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:17,840
executing

3303
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:18,840
those threads.

3304
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:19,840
So the

3305
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:20,840
hardware frees

3306
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:21,840
up and

3307
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:22,840
new threads

3308
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:23,840
will come

3309
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:24,840
and execute

3310
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:25,840
on that

3311
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:26,840
hardware.

3312
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:27,840
So think

3313
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:28,840
about threads

3314
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:29,840
as a

3315
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:30,840
software

3316
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:31,840
content.

3317
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:32,840
If you

3318
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:33,840
retire those

3319
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:34,840
warps,

3320
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:35,840
the GPU

3321
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:36,840
can be

3322
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:37,840
like,

3323
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:38,840
threads,

3324
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:39,840
you're done,

3325
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:40,840
go back,

3326
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:41,840
I don't

3327
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:42,840
need you

3328
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:43,840
in the

3329
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:44,840
scheduler,

3330
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:45,840
you're done.

3331
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:46,840
So

3332
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:47,840
that's

3333
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:48,840
essentially

3334
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:49,840
what happens.

3335
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:50,840
Yep?

3336
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:51,840
So even

3337
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:52,840
if they

3338
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:53,840
are not

3339
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:54,840
being

3340
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:55,840
used,

3341
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:56,840
since the

3342
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:57,840
scheduler has

3343
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:58,840
less

3344
01:14:58,840 --> 01:14:59,840
warp

3345
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:00,840
advantage,

3346
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:01,840
so there

3347
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:02,840
will be

3348
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:03,840
less

3349
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:04,840
overhead.

3350
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:05,840
So we

3351
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:06,840
will still

3352
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:07,840
make the

3353
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:08,840
algorithm

3354
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:09,840
run

3355
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:10,840
the best.

3356
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:12,840
So when

3357
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:13,840
you are

3358
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:14,840
returning

3359
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:15,840
threads early,

3360
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:16,840
when you

3361
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:17,840
call return

3362
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:18,840
inside a

3363
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:19,840
kernel,

3364
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:20,840
which you

3365
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:21,840
absolutely

3366
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:22,840
can,

3367
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:23,840
and all

3368
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:24,840
consecutive

3369
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:25,840
threads

3370
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:26,840
are hit

3371
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:27,840
return,

3372
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:28,840
it will

3373
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:29,840
retire the

3374
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:30,840
warp.

3375
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:31,840
The scheduler

3376
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:32,840
will get

3377
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:33,840
rid of it.

3378
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:34,840
So that's

3379
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:35,840
what happens.

3380
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:36,840
So hitting

3381
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:37,840
return is

3382
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:38,840
important.

3383
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:39,840
And

3384
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:40,840
then we

3385
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:41,840
have another

3386
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:42,840
task that

3387
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:43,840
would require

3388
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:44,840
like 50

3389
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:45,840
blocks.

3390
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:46,840
So

3391
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:47,840
they will

3392
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:48,840
say like

3393
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:49,840
the first

3394
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:50,840
one, the

3395
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:51,840
second one,

3396
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:52,840
the main

3397
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:53,840
one.

3398
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:54,840
So

3399
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:55,840
initially

3400
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:56,840
they will

3401
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:57,840
require

3402
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:58,840
a block

3403
01:15:58,840 --> 01:15:59,840
which

3404
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:00,840
was part

3405
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:01,840
of the

3406
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:02,840
doctrine

3407
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:03,840
that

3408
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:04,840
we

3409
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:05,840
were

3410
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:06,840
talking

3411
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:07,840
about.

3412
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:08,840
And

3413
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:09,840
then now

3414
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:10,840
we have

3415
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:11,840
three

3416
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:12,840
top

3417
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:13,840
blocks.

3418
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:14,840
So

3419
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:15,840
will

3420
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:16,840
the

3421
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:17,840
scheduler

3422
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:18,840
do

3423
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:19,840
okay?

3424
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:20,840
So I

3425
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:21,840
wouldn't

3426
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:22,840
put it

3427
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:23,840
that way.

3428
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:24,840
So let's

3429
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:25,840
say you're

3430
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:26,840
launching a

3431
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:27,840
million

3432
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:28,840
elements,

3433
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:29,840
okay, of

3434
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:30,840
10, 24

3435
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:31,840
blocks each.

3436
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:32,840
How many

3437
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:33,840
blocks do

3438
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:34,840
you have?

3439
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:35,840
You have

3440
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:36,840
1,000

3441
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:37,840
blocks.

3442
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:38,840
Can your

3443
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:39,840
1,000 blocks

3444
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:40,840
fit on the

3445
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:41,840
GPU?

3446
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:42,840
Yeah, they

3447
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:43,840
probably can.

3448
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:44,840
Doesn't mean

3449
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:45,840
they're executing

3450
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:46,840
at the same

3451
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:47,840
time in the

3452
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:48,840
GPU.

3453
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:49,840
Probably not.

3454
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:50,840
Okay.

3455
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:51,840
Just because

3456
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:52,840
they can be

3457
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:53,840
launched at

3458
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:54,840
once doesn't

3459
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:55,840
mean they're

3460
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:56,840
executing at

3461
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:57,840
once.

3462
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:58,840
They can be

3463
01:16:58,840 --> 01:16:59,840
hitting stalls.

3464
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:00,840
Remember how we

3465
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:01,840
saw the stalls

3466
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:02,840
chart?

3467
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:03,840
They can be

3468
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:04,840
hitting the

3469
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:05,840
stalls which

3470
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:06,840
doesn't

3471
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:07,840
mean they're

3472
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:08,840
executing at

3473
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:09,840
once.

3474
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:10,840
So if

3475
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:11,840
you have a

3476
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:12,840
warp that

3477
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:13,840
is not

3478
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:14,840
going to be

3479
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:15,840
doing any

3480
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:16,840
work, come

3481
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:17,840
in and fill

3482
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:18,840
it.

3483
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:19,840
It's just

3484
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:20,840
wasting our

3485
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:21,840
time.

3486
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:22,840
So that's

3487
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:23,840
why we

3488
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:24,840
will retire

3489
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:25,840
those

3490
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:26,840
warps and

3491
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:27,840
if we

3492
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:28,840
retire them

3493
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:29,840
we can

3494
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:30,840
bring in

3495
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:31,840
the warps

3496
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:32,840
that are

3497
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:33,840
going to

3498
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:34,840
be doing

3499
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:35,840
the work.

3500
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:36,840
You don't

3501
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:37,840
want people

3502
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:38,840
who don't

3503
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:39,840
have any

3504
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:40,840
work to be

3505
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:41,840
coming and

3506
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:42,840
sitting at

3507
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:43,840
the bank

3508
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:44,840
counter.

3509
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:45,840
You want

3510
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:46,840
people who

3511
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:47,840
are going to

3512
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:48,840
be withdrawing

3513
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:49,840
money and

3514
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:50,840
making

3515
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:51,840
transactions

3516
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:52,840
to be doing

3517
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:53,840
that.

3518
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:54,840
If you

3519
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:55,840
tell people

3520
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:56,840
to go

3521
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:57,840
away, you

3522
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:58,840
can take

3523
01:17:58,840 --> 01:17:59,840
new people.

3524
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:00,840
If you

3525
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:01,840
just keep

3526
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:02,840
people filling

3527
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:03,840
the form

3528
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:04,840
and

3529
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:05,840
letting

3530
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:06,840
them

3531
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:07,840
do the

3532
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:08,840
work,

3533
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:09,840
you can

3534
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:10,840
do that.

3535
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:11,840
What

3536
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:12,840
are the

3537
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:13,840
questions?

3538
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:14,840
Everybody

3539
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:15,840
understand?

3540
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:16,840
No more

3541
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:17,840
questions?

3542
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:18,840
All right.

3543
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:19,840
So before

3544
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:20,840
we start

3545
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:21,840
memory

3546
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:22,840
coalescing I

3547
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:23,840
think we

3548
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:24,840
can take a

3549
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:25,840
break.

3550
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:26,840
Let's come

3551
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:27,840
back at

3552
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:28,840
6.40.

3553
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:29,840
6.40.

3554
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:30,840
Thank

3555
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:31,840
you.
