1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
you

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,960
and I was mesmerized by this image because I couldn't tell what it was. It was obviously

3
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,480
not a photograph, but it didn't look like it was drawn. And when I read inside the article

4
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:56,000
that this thing was generated by an algorithm by a computer program, I was I was hooked.

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,920
So I was like, wow, I can create images using the same thing I've been learning for the

6
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,400
past few years, writing programs, something I had been wanting to do for forever, but

7
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,920
I have no natural talent at drawing. And I was always envious of my mother's side of

8
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,000
the family who are all naturally artistic. They were just born being able to draw, but

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,680
I couldn't do that. This thing I can do. So this is what I'm gonna do for the rest of

10
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:29,520
my life. So I poured myself into my Amiga once I got it, and I eventually figured out

11
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:38,240
enough math so I could write a basic sphere ray tracer. Took me a few years to get there.

12
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,200
And I came across this amazing newsletter. It was called the Ray Tracing Newsletter.

13
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,160
I don't know if Eric Haynes is on the call right now. Yeah, yeah. So he, it had his name

14
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:56,040
on it, this newsletter. I got it from this thing called a bulletin board system, a BBS.

15
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,720
None of you here probably know what that is, except us old timers. Before anybody had internet

16
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:07,720
access, people used to just set up their computers with a modem so that other people could dial

17
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:13,480
in and exchange information, and usually exchange pirated software. That's how we got our video

18
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:23,920
games and 3D software that I couldn't afford as a 12-year-old. So I had found this newsletter

19
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:31,160
on this one BBS, and then there was this funny-looking thing I couldn't quite make out. It was some

20
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:37,160
kind of address for where you can go get the rest of them, because this was number two

21
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:43,360
or number three. I forgot which edition of the newsletter, and I needed more. Eventually

22
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,640
I figured out that this funny address was for this thing called the internet. There

23
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,720
was an FTP site somewhere where I could go download the rest of them. So it took me a

24
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:59,000
while to go find a way onto the internet so I could go get more of these Ray Tracing Newsletters.

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And over the years, using the information I could glean from the internet, which this

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,280
is the late 80s now. Nobody was on the internet. Back then, it was all just text. And if you

27
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,920
weren't at a university that happened to have internet or at a company, there's no

28
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,720
internet for you. You had to be part of the elite group who had that. But I found this

29
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,360
one company that had put three Sun machines that I could dial into and pay them 20 bucks

30
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:37,360
a month to get access to it. I learned how to program computer graphics and taught myself

31
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,320
whatever math I could kind of figure out on my own before going to college. But a lucky

32
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:52,480
thing happened for me. In 1993, the same year I turned 18 years old, I happened to be living

33
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,440
in Los Angeles. That's where I was born and raised. Momentous things happened that year.

34
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:06,880
First, the web was born, which created the opportunity for the internet to become huge

35
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,840
and ubiquitous all of a sudden. NVIDIA was born that year. That was the same year NVIDIA

36
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:19,880
was started. And Jurassic Park came out. And most of you weren't alive when that happened.

37
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:25,560
But for those of us that loved computer graphics, we didn't have many places where we could

38
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:33,480
go apply computer graphics. Pixar had just started. It had spun off from Lucasfilm. They

39
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:39,480
were doing commercials for Listerine and Lifesavers and stuff just to stay afloat.

40
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,760
There were a few movies that had a little bit of computer graphics. Terminator 2 had

41
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,840
happened, which was a pretty big deal in the computer graphics world. But Jurassic Park

42
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:57,960
was when it exploded. Once people went to the theater and saw these dinosaurs come to

43
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:03,160
life, there was no going back. We were never going to be able to do visual effects the

44
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:11,200
old way because it was just so much better, so mesmerizing that this was the future. And

45
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,640
quite frankly, looking back on it now, I think had Jurassic Park could not happen, I think

46
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:23,640
maybe computer graphics would not be where it is today. It would maybe be delayed another

47
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:30,520
10 years. Because at that moment, there was a market that formed around computer graphics.

48
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:35,720
All of the studios in Los Angeles needed this thing now. It was super weird. You have companies

49
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:45,720
like Disney and Sony doing basic R&D in computer science, something that you would not expect

50
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,960
from any content companies. Just because there were no tools available, the algorithms didn't

51
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,680
exist to go create the things that we wanted to do. And they were essentially hiring anyone.

52
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,200
Anyone who knew anything about it. And I happened to be in Los Angeles doing this stuff for

53
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:08,320
a few years, for many years, on my own. And so I wiggled my way into Warner Brothers and

54
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,520
then into Disney, where I got to work on things that nobody in their right mind would let

55
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:22,280
me do this day and age. I would have to come to a place like UPenn and get a proper education

56
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:28,360
before they'd even allow me into the room, let alone let me create a whole new renderer

57
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:40,880
for hair and fur and things like that. So that led me through the next few years. Shazan

58
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,880
mentioned I had my own company after I left Disney, where I developed a renderer. I licensed

59
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:52,000
it to all the big studios. And at the time, I thought my love, my passion was doing visual

60
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:02,640
effects or rendering particularly for visual effects for movies. But NVIDIA called me in

61
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:09,320
2001 and they really wanted to hire me. And I had heard through the grapevine, I wasn't

62
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,040
supposed to know this, but somebody at SIGGRAPH had told me, an intern that was at NVIDIA,

63
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,740
that they were working on this programmable shading thing. And I got excited about the

64
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:26,400
idea of doing what took hours, hours per frame in my world, in the offline visual effects

65
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,560
world, doing that in real time so that you could interact with it, potentially have the

66
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:38,720
same quality and fidelity and realism that I was aspiring to in offline in real time,

67
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:45,800
which maybe would unlock the opportunity to create something like a metaverse. Now,

68
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,760
I wasn't using the term metaverse. I was, I had read William Gibson's books, Neuromancer

69
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:57,320
and all those even that predates Snow Crash. And so the term, the matrix and cyberspace

70
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:03,960
and all that stuff came from these books. The idea of jacking into an internet and experiencing

71
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,520
that was there, that maybe this might happen. So then I'll go give it a try, work there

72
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:14,320
for a few years. It'll probably be five years or so. I thought we would all be living in

73
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:20,480
a metaverse like thing. But it's been 20 and it turns out it takes a lot longer to do this

74
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:29,120
stuff than we always think. We go set about solving really hard problems. We minimize

75
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,600
them to something that we can comprehend and hope to do in a normal amount of time. Then

76
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,960
we find it's actually much harder, but still worth doing. I think if we didn't do that

77
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:44,040
minimization thing, we would never actually venture to do anything cause it'd be too daunting.

78
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:50,960
So I spent the last 20 years, essentially working on all things related to simulating

79
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:57,600
virtual worlds. And what I learned while I've been at NVIDIA is that my true love wasn't

80
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,960
making visual effects and it wasn't even making entertaining images. My true love was

81
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:09,240
just computer graphics. I love everything about computer graphics and it turns out that

82
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:15,840
there are other markets for computer graphics and more important markets for computer graphics

83
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,880
and things that are far more exciting to me. As much as I love making movies and then working

84
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:28,000
on video games, fundamentally those are entertainment and they're nice things to do. There's nothing

85
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,520
wrong with it, but there's something about creating robots that are going to help us

86
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:47,560
farm sustainably and building cities and structures that eliminate the 30% of waste and building

87
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:55,440
every one of these structures we create around us, 30% of waste and energy and material that

88
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,960
just goes away that we could potentially solve by using computer graphics, strangely enough.

89
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:06,440
And this other thing happened about 10 years ago that was kind of unexpected. Ever since

90
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,400
I was a kid, I've been reading about artificial intelligence and how it's right around the

91
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:19,240
corner and the idea of neural networks have existed since the 50s. We'd been dabbling

92
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,720
in them. There was a resurgence of them in around the 90s, around the time I was at these

93
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:30,840
studios and it never quite materialized. So I kind of resigned myself to thinking we're

94
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:38,560
not going to have anything close to intelligence from a computer in my lifetime. The idea of

95
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,200
a computer being able to tell the difference between a cat and a dog reliably in an image,

96
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,120
that was just something that we were never going to solve. And overnight that changed.

97
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:57,000
About 10 years ago, as probably many of you know, there was the ImageNet challenge, University

98
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,120
of Toronto, there's a few grad students who took basically a consumer supercomputer, a

99
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,080
video game machine with one of our GeForce gaming cards in there. And they took this

100
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:15,480
old idea of neural nets and they applied it, took a whole bunch of data that was collected

101
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:22,160
on the internet and they fed it through this algorithm that trained another algorithm that

102
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,680
can tell the difference between a cat and a dog reliably. And that basically changed

103
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:33,080
everything. From here on out, all software and all of the most advanced algorithms that

104
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,680
humans are ever going to create are likely going to be created by a machine. We're going

105
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:45,320
to create the algorithms that create the algorithms. And the way we do that is by feeding it data.

106
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:50,400
You need to have lots and lots of data. Now we can call it data, but I prefer to call

107
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,560
it life experience. What you're actually doing when you're training these AIs, we're doing

108
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:01,920
the same thing we do when we train humans and creatures, what you guys are experiencing

109
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:08,320
right now, there's all this data that you're ingesting, this life experience, as I'm speaking,

110
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:15,520
as you're taking the signals that come in through your sensors and training your brain,

111
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:23,520
that's exactly the same thing that we're doing with these AI systems. But it turns out that

112
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:30,200
the AIs we want to create, the most impactful ones are ones that can perceive and understand

113
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:38,560
our world, this world around us, not video game worlds or arbitrary things inside computers,

114
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,320
and ones that can act upon our world, like robots or self-driving cars and things that

115
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:50,360
can do things around us here. And in order to provide them with that life experience,

116
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:56,320
we can't rely on them learning inside our world. I mean, babies, we train them in our

117
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,800
world, we bring them into this world, they learn how to see, they learn depth perception,

118
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,920
they learn how to distinguish between their mother and other people and all of those things

119
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:13,160
through experience. But we don't want these mega robots that are inside car factories

120
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:19,080
that can pick up cars and place them wherever they like to learn on the job. That would

121
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:24,520
be pretty scary for them to just keep trying things and break things until they learn.

122
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,760
That's how babies learn. That's fine. We kind of tolerate it when they throw things,

123
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,320
but we don't want our robots learning how to drive on the road. I mean, I don't even

124
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,680
want my children learning how to drive like that. They're sitting up there, the two of

125
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:43,200
them, but we kind of just have to deal with it. That's how it works. So what are we going

126
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:49,320
to do? How are we going to create these AIs? How are we going to give them life experience?

127
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:55,920
It turns out the answer is in what we've been doing all along in computer graphics,

128
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:01,840
because advanced computer graphics is 3D computer graphics. And most of 3D computer graphics

129
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:11,280
isn't about the image part. It's about constructing a model of the world, the world around us.

130
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,800
It's about creating these 3D worlds and spaces that have rules that match the rules in our

131
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,200
real world, the rules of physics, the physics of how light interacts with matter, Newtonian

132
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:27,240
physics, and eventually maybe all the way down to quantum physics, but we don't normally

133
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,760
have to deal with those kinds of effects in the things we model. But if we can synthesize

134
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:41,360
these worlds and we can simulate them quickly enough, then we have this amazing playground

135
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,680
where we can give birth to artificial intelligence and we can train them and we can make them

136
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,880
good robots, good AIs before we bring them out into the real world. They can drive for

137
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:58,440
billions of miles inside the virtual world. They can do billions and billions of hours

138
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,720
working in factories and doing all the things so they can really perfect that before we

139
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:09,040
bring them out here. So with that, I'm going to talk a little bit about what we call the

140
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:15,040
industrial metaverse. There's been a lot of talk about metaverse, especially since last

141
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,120
year when Facebook renamed themselves to meta. Probably when I say the word metaverse,

142
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,360
many of you are probably groaning like, oh my God, this is another cheesy talk about

143
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:35,880
how we're going to be surfing with Mark Zuckerberg or something. That's part of it. I think social

144
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:41,120
and gaming experiences are definitely going to be part of this metaverse thing that's

145
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:47,200
happening. But the way we look at it, the metaverse is essentially an extension of the

146
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:55,280
internet. When I started in the internet in 1988, the interface of the internet was just

147
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:01,560
a text prompt. It was a console. I had to go log in with a 2400 baud modem. Guys probably

148
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,480
don't even know what baud is, but I had one. I had a 2400 baud modem and you would get

149
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:15,480
a Unix shell and you could type some abstract arcane commands into it and get information

150
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,560
back out of it, which was really amazing because you were connected to some of the smartest

151
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,900
people in the world instantaneously. It was already awesome. Unfortunately, that interface

152
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:32,400
limited it to a very small number of people, only people who knew the special arcane commands

153
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:38,160
and how to get access to it, and I kind of lucked into it. But when the web was introduced

154
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:45,880
in 1993, the interface changed and it opened it up to many more people. We now could have

155
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:50,720
people who knew how to understand a graphical user interface, which was a huge portion of

156
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:57,680
the world, who could deal with text and images and eventually video and all the other things

157
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:03,540
we put in the web, interact with the internet. And that took it from thousands of people

158
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:09,000
that were on the internet to millions and now billions of people that can interact.

159
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,840
This next era we're going into, I think, is as profound a change as the transition from

160
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:23,140
text to a two-dimensional web. The switch to a 3D web, one where our primary interface

161
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:30,380
to the internet is something that is similar or even, in many cases, matching what the

162
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:37,660
real world around us feels and looks like is fundamentally going to change the way we

163
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:41,980
interact with the internet overall. And if you think about it as an extension of the

164
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:47,700
internet, you can think, well, we do all kinds of stuff on the internet. We, of course, socialize.

165
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:52,740
We play video games. We do all those things. And those are the things we're talking about

166
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:58,340
with the metaverse. But we also use it to learn. We use it to work. We use it to build

167
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:04,900
things and to design things together. We use it to do our banking and order food and do

168
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:13,700
all kinds of stuff on there. The internet is much greater than social networks and video

169
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:19,460
games. And so will the metaverse be. Once we introduce this 3D spatial overlay on top

170
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:33,140
of the internet, that's going to unlock many, many superpowers.

171
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:39,980
So today, there are already many applications that are metaverse-y. We can see in video

172
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:46,220
games, people talk about Fortnite and Roblox and all of these being metaverse-like experiences.

173
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:51,980
We can debate whether the metaverse is here yet or not. I think it's kind of moot. It's

174
00:18:51,980 --> 00:19:01,260
just this spectrum that we're moving along into more 3D-ness of our internet experience.

175
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:10,180
But we can use the metaverse, this 3D overlay, for many purposes. And you're starting to

176
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:16,460
see many of them form already. People are using it for shopping for things online. You

177
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:23,980
can see what your furniture or clothes might look like. If you were to actually buy that,

178
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:29,180
how it might look on you, how it might look in the space that you're looking at. We're

179
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:37,220
really interested in all of the uses of the metaverse in industry. And I'll explain specifics

180
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:49,300
as to why. But before we can make use of all of this, we need to kind of set up the

181
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:55,380
foundation, the kind of ground rules for what the metaverse needs and has before we can

182
00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:03,020
even start forming a 3D internet. Building the 2D web and the internet where it is today,

183
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:08,940
it's been almost three decades. There's a lot of work and energy and money and time

184
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:16,020
and tears that have gone into building this. Building a 3D one is going to be even harder.

185
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,660
Everything 3D, those of you that are studying computer graphics right now, you already know

186
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:25,900
it's really, really hard. There's a lot of math involved. There's a lot of computation.

187
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:30,980
You never have enough compute. That's the rule. I mean, there's, for rendering, what

188
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:36,780
is it? Lin's law? Is that all renders take, offline renders take the same amount of time

189
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:42,540
no matter what processor? I threw out, I forgot exactly what it was, but we always find ways

190
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:50,020
to fill up our compute with more things to do. So, what are the things that we need in

191
00:20:50,020 --> 00:21:00,940
order to build this kind of 3D internet? First, we need open standards. If we go back to 1990

192
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:05,580
to 1973, when the web was born, and even further back when the internet was born with

193
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:12,860
DARPA in the seventies, every step of the way, it started with open standards. The people

194
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:20,660
who are building the bones of the internet and the web, they contributed the protocols,

195
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:29,020
the formats, the system design to the general public as standards and completely open from

196
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:37,540
the very start. This is a fundamental prerequisite for such a thing existing, because if you're

197
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:42,820
building a network, the measure of success is how many people connect to you or how many

198
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:47,420
connections you get. The only way you're going to get those connections is if everyone can

199
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:53,440
freely use the standards by which to connect. So, we need to have some fundamental basic

200
00:21:53,440 --> 00:22:03,480
open standards for 3D in general. We need different kinds of computers. You guys here

201
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:11,040
are doing a lot of computer graphics work on GPUs. It's been a long time since people

202
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:17,280
have argued that you could do computer graphics solely on a CPU. They're just not fast enough

203
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,240
for that particular purpose. What we're trying to do now with real-time computer graphics

204
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:30,880
that are distributed across the globe with hundreds or thousands of people participating

205
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,080
in the same world, this is going to require a different kind of computing system, a different

206
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:42,640
network, ways of distributing the computation so that lots of the computation can be shared

207
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,580
from a data center, but some computation is done at the edge, right next to the user,

208
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:54,740
because latency matters so much. So, we need to build new kinds of computers. We need new

209
00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:00,260
algorithms. This is where you guys come in. If you decide to continue in computer graphics

210
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:13,420
past what you're learning here, maybe you can work on some of these algorithms to accelerate

211
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:22,900
and, with as much fidelity and accuracy as possible, simulate the world around us. For

212
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:29,740
entertainment purposes, we can often cheat. We cheat with the physics of the world around

213
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:36,500
us. We just need the thing to kind of look cool, not necessarily actually behave correctly.

214
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:41,020
But for many of the uses we have for this metaverse thing that's happening, for the

215
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:45,980
industrial metaverse, it's not okay for it to just look right. It has to actually behave

216
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:52,780
correctly. And doing this in real time and even super real time is critical. If we're

217
00:23:52,780 --> 00:24:00,060
going to give our AIs millions and millions of years of life, life experience, in the

218
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:07,380
time it takes us to experience a cup of coffee, then we're going to need very, very fancy

219
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:14,900
algorithms that can do this kind of accuracy quickly. Finally, there's a whole lot of AI

220
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:21,940
that's coming into play here. So, at NVIDIA, we live at the intersection of computer graphics

221
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:27,820
and artificial intelligence, high-performance computing in general. And it's mind-blowing

222
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:36,460
to me, almost like too much. Every day I see new things coming out from AI research that

223
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:45,420
is completely disruptive to everything I've known about computer graphics from the beginning.

224
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:50,020
I don't believe that AI is completely going to replace everything that we're learning

225
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:55,140
here. I think we need all these fundamentals. But the interplay between AI and traditional

226
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:02,900
computer graphics and principle simulation methods is the key to the future. There's

227
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:09,900
no way we're going to have enough computational power to simulate even small worlds like the

228
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:17,580
world we have right here with the physical accuracy that we need anytime soon. The supercomputers

229
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:25,180
we need to do this would end up being larger than the world itself or larger than the universe.

230
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:31,580
You need more atoms than the universe to simulate all the atoms that are here. So, we need some

231
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:41,500
clever tricks to approximate all that. And AI gives us that. The other thing AI is really

232
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:47,940
accelerating is the inverse of computer graphics, which is computer vision. We need a way to

233
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:58,540
build worlds that we simulate inside our simulators. How do you build such worlds? Today, we have

234
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:04,220
experts at the top game studios, the AAA game studios, or at visual effects studios, who

235
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:09,940
know how to do very specific aspects of the world building. Some people are experts at

236
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:14,860
modeling things around us. They can model the buildings, the chairs. Some people know

237
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:20,260
how to create humans or faces, and some know how to animate them and texture them. And

238
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:25,340
they spend decades becoming experts at those. There's just not enough of these people around.

239
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:30,740
There's maybe thousands, hundreds of thousands of experts in the world that could do it at

240
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:35,660
that level. And that's just not enough. If we're going to build a 3D web, if we're going

241
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:46,060
to build a metaverse, then everyone needs to be able to create within this new medium,

242
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:53,340
just like with the 2D web. None of you are around, except for Steve and Patrick and me,

243
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:58,340
when the web came about. One of the amazing things about it was, anybody could create

244
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:05,060
a web page. All you needed was a text editor. You could type up some HTML and put it up

245
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:10,220
on a web server, and you had a web page. And that's how the web became what it is today,

246
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:15,900
because everybody could participate in creating there. And that's still true today. Most of

247
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:22,500
the content on the internet is not created by a small elite group of people creating

248
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:30,620
all of that content. It's created by you guys. You put stuff up on YouTube and TikTok and

249
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:37,060
not Facebook. I think all of you are too young here for that. But all of these social networks

250
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:43,560
and sites and stuff, unfortunately, that's not possible with 3D content today. The average

251
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:51,760
person cannot create a 3D game or a 3D experience. It's just too hard. So with AI, we potentially

252
00:27:51,760 --> 00:28:00,360
have the promise of tools that will allow average people to create 3D experiences and

253
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:11,200
content in the same way we can all create videos and photos and the written word today.

254
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:18,840
I mentioned open standards being critical. We have settled on one particular standard

255
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,640
as being the most critical at this moment in time. It's a standard called universal

256
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:32,080
scene description. It was invented by Pixar and open sourced about seven years ago. Seven

257
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:39,400
years ago. So when we saw it, we thought, this is pretty amazing. Because in the years

258
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,040
that I've been doing computer graphics, there have been many proposed standards that were

259
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:49,220
supposed to be the kind of universal standard to describe everything. Even in the very early

260
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:57,160
days of the web, I think it was 1994, there was VRML, VRML, right after it built based

261
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:04,340
on SGI's inventor. Yeah, it's too old for you guys to know. But it's an interesting

262
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:11,520
bit of history. There's been a bunch of formats that have been introduced. Collada, Autodesk

263
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:21,080
had FBX. But none of them had all of the right things. It needed to be open. Truly

264
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:30,280
open. It needed to be extensible. And with what we saw with USD, there was a lot more

265
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:35,280
than just the file format or the description of things. There's this notion of composing

266
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:43,640
worlds and allowing multiple people working together on different parts of the world

267
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:52,800
simultaneously and in harmony. This was essentially wisdom that Pixar had gained over the decades.

268
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:58,120
They've been creating large virtual worlds that ended up encoded in USD. The ideas that

269
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:05,400
are in USD had existed in different tools and systems they had before them. And if you

270
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:12,240
think about it, no company, no enterprise or group has been building large virtual worlds

271
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:18,880
using a heterogeneous set of tools with different disciplines, all contributing, hundreds and

272
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:26,040
hundreds of people contributing same virtual world for as long as Pixar. So they just hit

273
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:32,480
that right balance of things necessary in this format. We saw it and said, this looks

274
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:41,560
kind of like how HTML was in the early days. Insufficient for where we want it to go, but

275
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:49,320
has the basic foundation that we can add to and build on so we can eventually get there.

276
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:56,960
And so we've settled on this and it turns out many others are coming to the same conclusion

277
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:03,560
now. We were one of the early ones, the earliest to invest in it. A lot of people assume that

278
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:08,940
because it came from Pixar, that it's limited to media entertainment, but we saw it as general

279
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:13,360
enough so that it could apply to everything. So we're using it for robotics. We're using

280
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:22,000
it for AEC, architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, and so on and so forth. I'll

281
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,480
skip past that. I mentioned that we're going to need new forms of computing to power this

282
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:38,400
kind of 3D web. I can't stress that enough. It's not enough to just write algorithms anymore,

283
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:44,720
especially in this post-Moore's law world we're in. I mean, you guys are too young to

284
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:52,200
remember, but when I was a kid, I could write a program and be really lazy. And two years

285
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,320
later, my program ran two, three times faster. I didn't have to do anything else. It just

286
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:03,280
ran faster. And I could write my code without worrying about anything, without really worrying

287
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:09,760
about the architecture of the processor I was writing to. The good folks at Intel and

288
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:16,200
these guys making CPUs would just figure out how to take my same code and make it run faster

289
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:22,800
without me changing it. All of that changed about almost 20 years ago, the moment Intel

290
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:28,120
decided to go dual core, because that was essentially an admission that the extra transistors

291
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:34,320
that we're throwing at these processors don't just give us the automatic speed ups. You

292
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,800
had to now refactor your programs, your algorithms to take advantage of parallelism, which is

293
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:48,920
really hard. And so that opened up this future. This is why NVIDIA is what it is today.

294
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:55,360
We build accelerators that accelerate very specific workloads, starting with computer

295
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:02,720
graphics, but also physics simulation and AI. The future is more of that. We're going

296
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,600
to have more specialized types of computers that are optimal in terms of energy, in terms

297
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:20,160
of cost, in terms of computational density, that cater to different types of algorithms.

298
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:25,320
The idea that you could just write all of your software for one general purpose processor

299
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:31,760
and then go scale that up in the cloud is gone. And in the world of computer graphics

300
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,920
and real time computer graphics, ones where we're experiencing these worlds together,

301
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:41,600
high fidelity worlds, this is even more important. There's no way we're going to make cost effective

302
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:49,480
computing if we don't take advantage of the computing architectures that are most optimal

303
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:54,680
for this. So this problem isn't just limited to the amount of compute. It's also the amount

304
00:33:54,680 --> 00:34:02,940
of data. Computer graphics, 3D worlds are essentially limitless in the hunger for data.

305
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:09,360
You can always describe something with more detail, requiring more bits of information.

306
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:18,640
So storage and bandwidth matters a lot. Latency matters a lot. If your compute is too far

307
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:27,520
away from you, you have a literal speed of light problem. If you make a motion here and

308
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:34,520
somebody on the other side of the world is going to react to your motion, then you're

309
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:40,240
limited by how fast that information can travel from here to the other side of the earth.

310
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:46,280
You add in all of the networking layers, all of the hops, and everything about the internet.

311
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:52,320
It wasn't really designed for these kinds of real-time applications. So we have to rearchitect

312
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,160
the internet completely so that we can distribute the compute where it needs to be. Sometimes

313
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,040
it's going to be close to you. It'll be on your device. Sometimes it's going to be in

314
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:10,120
a 5G tower that's not too far away. Or it'll be in a data center maybe a few cities away.

315
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:15,560
And occasionally it's going to be someplace really far away on another continent. We have

316
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:22,680
to distribute our algorithms across all of this and take advantage of the opportunities

317
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:27,440
in each location.

318
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:33,240
Maybe some of you have heard the term digital twin. That's another term that's been thrown

319
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:39,880
around a lot these days along with metaverse. There are many definitions of it. Our definition

320
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:46,720
is a pretty simple one. We already know about virtual worlds. That's what you guys are working

321
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:52,680
on here with your computer graphics. You build these virtual worlds and you simulate them.

322
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:58,720
What goes into a virtual world is these basic ingredients these days. You have rendering,

323
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:04,760
which is how things look. Essentially the simulation of how light interacts with matter

324
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:10,720
or electromagnetic waves. You don't have to limit it to the visible light spectrum.

325
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,680
We can simulate other types of sensors as well. General physics, how things behave inside

326
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:23,640
this world. And then AI is another fundamental ingredient for worlds because there are agents

327
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:28,800
inside these worlds that do things. And so they're the non-player characters in your

328
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:35,120
video games or maybe a robot inside your virtual factory. Those are things that would

329
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,120
use an AI.

330
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:46,240
But if you can create a simulator that matches the real world closely enough and you can

331
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:52,880
model that world closely enough to a real world thing, then you gain this opportunity

332
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,520
to link the simulator to the real world. You can take something. So in this case, we're

333
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:04,120
showing a factory. We're doing a lot of work with BMW who came to us because they have

334
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:11,400
this big problem. Every factory they create for every new car is more complex than the

335
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,480
previous one. Cars are getting more complex. Those machines are getting more complex. And

336
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,800
the machines that they build to build the machines are even more complex. There's lots

337
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:26,200
of software and lots of stuff going on in there. And the only way they can build these

338
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:32,880
factories that they invest billions of dollars in is by simulating them first to ensure that

339
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,520
they're good factories before they invest the billions of dollars to actually construct

340
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:42,200
it. Thousands of people working on this thing. But the nice thing about things like

341
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:49,040
factories is they're already instrumented with a lot of sensors and IoT devices and

342
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:53,760
things that can tell you information about the state of the factory. You can know what

343
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,160
the joint angle of every robot is inside that factory. You could potentially even know the

344
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:05,600
joint angles of the humans inside the factory with camera sensors and AI technology to get

345
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:12,320
their poses and whatnot. You know the state of every conveyor belt and machine. There's

346
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:17,360
encoders on every device. You know the temperatures and energy usage and all that stuff. So if

347
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:23,200
you can get all of that information that's happening in real time and extract it and

348
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:29,640
project it into your model in the virtual version of that, then you essentially have

349
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:35,760
a digital twin. You have the real world thing and you have a virtual version of it that's

350
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:41,360
kind of an approximation. But the two are kept in sync. So whatever is happening in

351
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:47,640
the real world, sometime very soon after it happens there, you can experience it inside

352
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:54,240
the virtual world. This gives us a few superpowers that are pretty amazing if you think about

353
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:01,240
it. The first one is teleportation. So if I can create a factory that is a reflection

354
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:08,960
of the exact state of the factory in the real world inside the virtual world, then I don't

355
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:14,040
actually have to go to that factory physically in order to experience it. I could put on

356
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:19,680
a VR headset or just look at it through my monitor like a video game, go fly into that

357
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,240
factory to any point and teleport around. And the state of what I'm seeing should be

358
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:31,120
the same as what's in the real world. That's essentially teleportation. And as we make

359
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:37,440
our algorithms better and better and we match the world more closely, it eventually becomes

360
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:44,720
indistinguishable. If we can render it so that it looks exactly the same, if we can

361
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:50,640
reflect the state of everything exactly the same way, then you might as well not go to

362
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:56,920
the place. You can just do that remotely. You can also travel to the past if you record

363
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:02,760
all of that state over time. So if you take the state that's streaming in in real time,

364
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:09,040
let's put it in storage, you get a rewind scrub bar. So not only can you teleport,

365
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,400
but you can time travel. You can go to any point in time in the past and experience it

366
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:19,800
at that moment in time. But where it gets awesome is if you have a simulator that really

367
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:29,560
does match the physics of the real world close enough so that you can predict the future.

368
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:37,960
If you can tell that the factory is likely to have a stoppage because the configuration

369
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:44,640
of the factory at that moment in time, something's going to overheat or some robots are going

370
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,440
to crash into each other or whatever you can predict, if you can do that well enough, then

371
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,720
essentially you have time travel into the future. This is where computation matters

372
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:58,120
a lot. If you can do it faster than it happens in real life, then you have the potential

373
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:07,440
to alter the actual future before the tragedy happens. And so we can travel into the future.

374
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,720
If you can simulate it really, really fast, then you can potentially experiment with many

375
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,400
possible futures. You can say, well, what if I moved around some stuff? I can change

376
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:24,280
my factory line and reconfigure it so the robots are spaced apart like this and maybe

377
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:29,720
change the speeds and feeds in there and do an optimization. Find the best possible

378
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:37,560
future to minimize energy usage, minimize waste, maximize employee safety, factory workers,

379
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:42,160
so on and so forth. And you can pick the future you like, the one that you want, and go apply

380
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:49,360
that in the real world. So these basic superpowers that the digital twins give you can be applied

381
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:54,720
to just about everything at every scale. We're already starting to do this. We're

382
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:02,400
doing it at the molecular scale. We're creating digital twins of vaccines and human cells.

383
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:10,240
So we can go do experiments using computational chemistry to try out many, many different

384
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:16,280
cures for diseases and drugs and medicines and whatnot. I mentioned the factory use case.

385
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:21,960
That one's kind of pretty obvious. We're doing it at city scales. We're working with

386
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:30,400
many, many different companies to do things like simulate radio propagation of 5G signals

387
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,080
throughout a city. If you have a good model of your city, and you know where the towers

388
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:39,820
are, and you know the equipment you have and the software that's driving it, radio these

389
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:45,840
days is really, really complex stuff. It's all active. There's beam forming and all kinds

390
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:52,760
of crazy, crazy stuff the towers are doing to optimize your signal, minimize latency,

391
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:59,040
and maximize bandwidth to each user. We can model all of that stuff and have efficient

392
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:05,320
placement, efficient in terms of energy, in terms of cost, in terms of maximizing potential

393
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:12,480
bandwidth and usage. And finally, at the planetary scale, we're building digital twins of the

394
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,680
whole Earth. I think probably most people here would agree that we have this little

395
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:25,000
climate problem thing happening, and nobody really knows what to do. There's a lot of

396
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,240
theories as to how we might be able to fix it. Some people just think it's impossible

397
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:34,480
to fix. There's nothing we can do. One thing that's probably clear is that whatever the

398
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:40,680
fix is, it's going to be expensive, and it's going to take a lot of time to implement.

399
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:46,760
And we probably aren't going to have multiple chances at doing that. So how do we convince

400
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:53,880
ourselves that whatever solution we go invest in, and convince enough people to invest in

401
00:43:53,880 --> 00:44:00,280
the solution, to actually go invest trillions of dollars and decades into doing the right

402
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:06,560
thing? With this fog of war we have, we don't know exactly what the right solution is. The

403
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:11,760
only way is to actually build a digital twin of the Earth. If we can model climate change,

404
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:18,560
if we can model the weather and climate systems of the Earth, and we can prove to ourselves

405
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:24,000
that given historic data, we could predict the future that happened, and we can run the

406
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:34,240
simulator alongside the real world, and see if our simulator can match the future that

407
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:40,880
does actually happen, and build a computer with algorithms that does this, then we can

408
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:47,320
potentially experiment with possible futures. We can take our simulation of the Earth, and

409
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:53,800
we can try a few different experiments, or many experiments, and see which one is likely

410
00:44:53,800 --> 00:45:00,680
to be the best solution. We might have a chance of convincing enough people in the world to

411
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:04,800
go invest in such a thing. We're working on that. We're actually building a supercomputer

412
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:14,480
to do this kind of climate science and climate modeling that'll predict out to 20, 30 years

413
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:20,400
at extremely high resolutions, down to the meter scale resolutions a year. Not only can

414
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:27,240
you tell what the average temperature of the Earth would be, but what will the temperature

415
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:31,480
at your house be like 20 years from now? If you can make it personal like that for

416
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:36,040
everyone, and you can convince them that it's accurate enough, that it predicted it, then

417
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:42,840
maybe we've got a chance. I'm going to play a little video here that shows some cool stuff

418
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:47,640
we've been doing in robotics with digital twins. Here's an example of a digital twin

419
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:52,120
we built of a warehouse, something that is pretty important these days, given everybody

420
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:57,000
just orders everything on the internet from Amazon, or wherever else, and there's warehouses

421
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:03,440
like this that are fulfilling all that stuff. This first one here is, yeah, there's three

422
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:09,400
different robots. The first one it's going to show is this Fraunhofer AMR robot. With

423
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:16,120
our simulation stack, which is called Omniverse, Shazan mentioned that's the thing I've been

424
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:24,560
working on for a while, we can model this robot almost exactly. We can take every part

425
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:30,560
from the original CAD design and piece it together and place it inside this virtual

426
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:39,840
world and model the physics of the AMR and every aspect of it. Same is true here with

427
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:46,280
this robotic arm. I forgot which one this is. You can see the real world on the left

428
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:52,680
side and the simulated world on the right side in the earlier portion of it. I think

429
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:59,320
I'll show you that again. They match close enough so that we can use all of the data

430
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:04,960
that's generated in simulation to train AIs for it. That was images being generated to

431
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:12,400
train its perception systems. Here's another example of a cool robot. These guys in Zurich

432
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:20,520
at ETH Zurich decided to give it wheels. Inside our simulated world, our physics was close

433
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:25,440
enough to the real world that it could completely learn how to stand on its hind legs and move

434
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:32,640
around on wheels, this quadruped, without ever trying it in the real world first. We

435
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,720
essentially created its brain. We trained its brain inside the virtual world and we

436
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:53,680
transferred it to the real robot and it works. You know, I don't know how to answer it directly

437
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:59,600
because I haven't looked at the stats, but you can see there's a farm of robots. The

438
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:12,320
way we usually do it with these reinforcement learning systems is we'll have hundreds or

439
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:17,880
thousands of the robots. In every iteration, you have a whole bunch of them randomly trying

440
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:23,360
kind of different things. Whichever one is the best, we take its brain and then we feed

441
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:30,080
it back into the loops for the next iteration or next batch of them. So the amount of life

442
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:35,120
experience would be the aggregate of all of the experience of each of those robots. What's

443
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:41,880
amazing about this one, we have another demo where we have it training live. So they start

444
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,960
with the robot. It doesn't know how to walk. It doesn't know how to do anything. And they're

445
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:54,000
holding it in place like a baby cow or something that just came to life. And they have a computer

446
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,680
running doing the reinforcement learning and within a minute or two, it can walk. And you

447
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:06,160
see it taking its first steps and doing everything in the virtual world and they're taking instances

448
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:13,200
of its brain and bringing it back in. So we can give it millions of hours of life experience in

449
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:20,960
in minutes. And that was all done with just one GPU on our part. One GPU because it's

450
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,680
extremely parallel. We can do many robots simultaneously and do all the physics for each

451
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:38,640
one. Okay. So for this section, give you a little summary. Some takeaways, if anything's going to

452
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,880
stick in your brain, some of these bullet points I think would be a good one. The metaverse is much

453
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:50,800
more than social networking and entertainment. If you just replace metaverse with internet

454
00:49:52,240 --> 00:50:00,720
that has 3D, 3D spatial overlay, then you can see that it's obvious that it's much more than that

455
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:08,400
because the internet is much more than just socializing. Open 3D standards are a hard

456
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:14,400
requirement for the metaverse. There's really no way we're going to be creating a 3D web if we

457
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:21,360
don't have some agreement on how we describe the things inside these worlds and how we communicate

458
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:28,240
them to each other. This is extremely important. Even though in terms of research, a lot of these

459
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:33,040
things are largely solved problems, the implementation and turning them into standards

460
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:38,160
is still really hard. There's a long road ahead. And there's some excellent people in this room

461
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:46,080
working on that problem with us. We're really excited about it. We need a new computing

462
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:52,160
architecture. The types of computers that we need to build and the networks that we need to build

463
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:57,360
are going to look very different than the ones that we have today. So if you're

464
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:05,840
interested at all in the fundamentals of computing and computer engineering,

465
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:11,840
that all this might be an area that you could work towards on the actual computers themselves.

466
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:21,520
We need to have real-time and high-fidelity accurate simulations to create

467
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:29,280
the metaverse that we're hoping to create. If we only have computer graphics that just

468
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,960
looks cool, then it's not going to be sufficient to get those superpowers I was talking about.

469
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:43,520
The next era of computer graphics, I'm hoping, is all about actually being like the real world.

470
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:50,320
We've largely been applying computer graphics to entertainment, to visual effects, and then

471
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:55,280
video games. NVIDIA benefited from this when we were born. We were born right at that era.

472
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:05,680
But it's not sufficient for where we need to go. I think recreating the real world is far

473
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:11,360
more interesting than creating fantasy worlds in most cases, and much harder.

474
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:18,000
AIs are going to be born in the metaverse. And so the previous thing is necessary in order to

475
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:25,040
make sure our AIs don't learn the wrong rules. We don't want our self-driving cars to learn in a

476
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:33,280
Looney Tunes universe. Cartoon physics is not something we want them to assume when they're

477
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:39,840
driving on the roads with us. And we're going to need a lot of AIs to help us build the metaverse.

478
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:47,040
We have to have a lot of stuff inside the metaverse. We need cities and spaces and

479
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:52,960
buildings and parks and humans and creatures and all of these things in there. And there's no way

480
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:58,240
we're going to be able to construct each one of these things by hand. So the intersection of

481
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:02,800
artificial intelligence and computer graphics is really important. Otherwise, we're just going to

482
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:10,480
hit a hard wall. That's going to be our bottleneck. All right. So that was that one. I don't know how

483
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:16,480
much time we have left. Yeah, I've been talking for about an hour. I can talk for another five,

484
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:24,000
six hours if you guys want. I don't know if my kids up there would be happy if I could talk for

485
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:33,280
another five, six hours. You guys want to do some questions? Yes? You're nodding.

486
00:53:46,480 --> 00:54:13,280
Very good question.

487
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:21,400
So from my perspective, all of them are important.

488
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,760
When we're building robots, they actually

489
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,280
have many sensors that aren't just visual.

490
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:30,480
Or they see, even their visual senses

491
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,560
are outside of the human visual spectrum.

492
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:38,280
We have LIDARs, and radar, and these ultrasonics.

493
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,440
So we're modeling all of that stuff

494
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:45,040
inside our omniverse-based simulators.

495
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,960
There's other sensors as well that

496
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,760
aren't dealing with waves.

497
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,480
There's haptic sensors.

498
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,980
So we need to model that as well.

499
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:00,940
It's really important.

500
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:06,600
That Fraunhofer robot I showed, the AMR with all the parts,

501
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:10,880
if the movement, the haptics aren't correct with that,

502
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,640
it can't learn correctly.

503
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:16,080
The animal robot that was standing on the wheels,

504
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,160
same thing.

505
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,240
For humans, I think the most important sense

506
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,800
turns out to be visual.

507
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,840
That's what we have the most neurons in our brain dedicated

508
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,360
to over all the other ones.

509
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,720
It's a really powerful sense.

510
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:36,520
But when we see, we're not really seeing with our eyes.

511
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,360
We're seeing with our brain.

512
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,600
Our eyes are just a way to collect

513
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,080
the signal coming from the world,

514
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,880
the electromagnetic waves.

515
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,760
It transforms it into an electrical signal,

516
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,680
and that hits our brain somewhere.

517
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,320
And in our brain, we're doing a rendering

518
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,480
of the world around us.

519
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,880
That's how we're actually seeing.

520
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,320
There's a renderer inside your brain.

521
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:03,760
And so the rendering of the visual aspects

522
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,560
of computer graphics is more than just the image.

523
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:13,600
It's how we kind of understand the 3D space around us.

524
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,840
And so I think that that's always

525
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:18,640
going to be an extremely important aspect

526
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,920
of the simulations we do.

527
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:25,360
But we're doing far more than simulating the visible light

528
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:25,860
spectrum.

529
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,480
You have any more questions?

530
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,080
Or maybe we'll let somebody else ask,

531
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,560
and then we'll wrap it around.

532
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,080
Yes?

533
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:36,560
Yeah.

534
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:40,080
I kind of want to ask, is this kind of analogous

535
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,560
to what you were talking about?

536
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,640
Absolutely.

537
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:53,520
So when the web was born, there were two standards

538
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,320
that were critical.

539
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:57,360
HTTP was one of them, and that's the transport protocol.

540
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:01,520
That's how you exchange the information.

541
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,120
But then there's the content itself,

542
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,200
the information content.

543
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,600
That was HTML, and still is.

544
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:10,160
We've just enhanced HTML over the years to HTML5,

545
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,720
and we added JavaScript, and all these other things

546
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,760
that unlock stuff in there.

547
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:17,760
So the standard I was talking about,

548
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:24,280
universal scene description, is analogous to HTML.

549
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:28,080
And if you look at HTML's journey from HTML1 to 5,

550
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,000
it took almost two decades.

551
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
HTML1 came in 1993, and I think HTML5

552
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,480
was finalized in 2010, almost 17 years or so

553
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,600
before it was finalized.

554
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:45,080
But there were many, many attempts

555
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,960
made at different aspects of the standard.

556
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,680
There's almost a Darwinian thing that

557
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,760
happens with these standards.

558
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,720
It's kind of weird we ended up with JavaScript

559
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:59,000
as being the language of the web.

560
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,840
I don't think anybody would have predicted that one.

561
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:01,800
Did you predict that?

562
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,960
I wouldn't have predicted that.

563
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:10,680
It's not a particularly good language, and whatnot.

564
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:11,680
Some people may love it.

565
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:14,560
I'm sorry if I offended anyone, but nobody

566
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:15,800
was predicting that one.

567
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,320
But it turned out to be fine for this purpose,

568
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:24,120
and it was better than the other things that showed up.

569
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:28,840
Microsoft had ActiveX that was proprietary and not open.

570
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:34,000
Then there was Adobe Flash, which had

571
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,920
a whole host of other problems.

572
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:40,480
JavaScript is open, and it could be

573
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,440
extended to solve all the problems,

574
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,960
even if it's not always in the most elegant way at first.

575
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,880
And so we're going to see the same thing happen

576
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,760
with 3D standards, and I think it's going to be built on USD.

577
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:56,680
And so where my focus is, and what my team is working on,

578
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:00,000
is extending this in the open so that we

579
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,560
don't have to wait 17 years to go from USD1 to USD5.

580
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:08,680
We want to do that much faster, and learn from our past.

581
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,760
We can see what worked and what didn't in the past,

582
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:13,920
and apply the good things, and put more energy there.

583
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:25,040
That's a really good question.

584
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:29,440
Patrick over here is at Cesium.

585
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,480
He's the CEO of Cesium, right?

586
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:35,760
And they've been contributing to 3D standards, 3D tiles.

587
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,440
And they're not a particularly big company,

588
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:41,440
but very active in this.

589
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:45,200
A new forum was formed a few months ago

590
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,320
called the Metaverse Standards Forum.

591
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,680
It was kind of an outshoot of the Kronos Group

592
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:53,640
that was OpenGL and Vulkan.

593
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,000
They set it up.

594
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:55,720
It's within that.

595
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,760
But it's not really a Kronos thing,

596
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,960
but Kronos helped create it.

597
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:04,720
And the president of it, Neil Trevitt,

598
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:08,240
who's the president of Kronos, works for NVIDIA too.

599
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,720
But there's like 2,000 companies that

600
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,280
have joined this thing to discuss

601
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:15,520
how we're going to do that.

602
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,480
Generally, the way these things work, though,

603
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,920
is only a small number of companies

604
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,440
actually do the hard work and contribute

605
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,400
code and engineering.

606
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,400
There'll be a few small companies that do that,

607
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,640
but the ones that have the resources to do it really

608
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:30,240
will do the most.

609
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,440
And so we're doing that.

610
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,480
We've been investing in USD.

611
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:37,720
And we foresaw this Metaverse 3D web thing

612
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,600
happening many years ago.

613
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,600
So we started hiring people specifically

614
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:42,640
to go work on that.

615
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:48,040
And we have a large team that does nothing but add to USD.

616
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,360
To us, it's vital.

617
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,760
We're a computer graphics company.

618
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:52,920
We're an AI company.

619
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,360
We're a computing company.

620
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,480
We need to have an open standard for all

621
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,920
of the content in the world so that we

622
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:05,200
have things to compute on, so we can justify making that spend.

623
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,440
Another one that's been surprising,

624
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:11,800
is not really known for open standards and stuff, is Apple.

625
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:16,560
Apple, every iPhone, every iPad, every Safari browser

626
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:17,880
natively supports USD.

627
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:21,400
You can drag and drop USD, USDZ files into it

628
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:22,520
and tumble them around.

629
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:29,760
And RealityKit, ARKit, all that stuff is built on USD.

630
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:30,920
So they're behind it.

631
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:34,360
They made some great contributions to it.

632
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,840
And we're seeing everybody else come in.

633
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:42,600
Epic Games, Unity, Autodesk, all the people

634
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,800
you would expect who would have an interest in this.

635
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:47,880
Adobe is jumping in as well.

636
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:48,380
Yes.

637
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:15,080
I could do it on the record.

638
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,760
I mean, off the record.

639
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,720
And maybe if we have some time, I'll show you a few other use

640
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,520
cases of this as well.

641
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:27,400
Yeah, so the question was, can I share

642
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,720
any examples of non-social?

643
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,760
Oh, you want me to give you thoughts on the social side?

644
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:38,680
Thoughts in terms of what?

645
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:39,800
The ethics of it, or?

646
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:43,280
Yeah, so the question is, what are my thoughts

647
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:47,960
on the social and gaming side of the Metaverse?

648
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:52,440
Because mostly I've been talking about the non-social side.

649
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:53,480
I'm an avid gamer.

650
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,920
I mean, that's one of the reasons I was at NVIDIA.

651
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,360
I've worked on video games at NVIDIA

652
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:00,320
for most of my career here.

653
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:02,000
And I continue to play video games.

654
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,800
I go home, and I've been playing a lot of Overwatch 2 lately.

655
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,800
And I've been playing a lot of Overwatch 2

656
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,920
I've been playing a lot of Overwatch 2 lately.

657
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,120
That's my thing.

658
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,560
For the first time in a long time,

659
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:18,040
my kids also are playing the same game I play.

660
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:21,360
And so we get to play together.

661
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:25,360
I think that already exists.

662
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:30,520
It's like, without us doing anything,

663
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:35,880
I think socializing and playing video games in 3D

664
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:37,920
with multiple people in the same world

665
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:40,200
and interacting with each other, that's going to happen

666
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,720
because it's already happened.

667
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:43,760
I know my kids have grown up in that world.

668
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:48,000
They grew up with Minecraft and Fortnite.

669
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,920
And they didn't play Roblox too much.

670
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:52,880
But all the other games they're playing,

671
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,680
and the most interesting games and the ones

672
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:57,800
that are really sticky are the ones that are multiplayer,

673
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:03,480
ones where many are socializing inside these worlds.

674
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:06,160
Much to my wife's chagrin,

675
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:11,680
I got really into World of Warcraft about 10 years ago.

676
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:20,120
I tortured her through my hardcore raiding experiences.

677
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:26,040
But I could understand how it's possible to feel

678
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:29,640
that this virtual world that I'm projecting myself into

679
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:32,120
is as real as the one that's out here.

680
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:36,840
I used to raid every night or every other night,

681
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:42,040
basically, for many hours with 20 other people.

682
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:46,920
And it's like this camaraderie and relationships and stuff

683
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:50,000
form that's not exactly the same as the ones with people

684
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:56,920
in real life, but just as intense and real to me.

685
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:00,560
So I think that part of the metaverse has already happened.

686
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,000
I've experienced it.

687
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,600
We're just going to get more and more immersive.

688
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:08,280
It's going to become even more natural.

689
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:11,960
We're not going to have to go out of our way to go enter it.

690
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,240
It's going to be all around us.

691
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,360
We're going to have glasses and eventually implants

692
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,040
in our brains or whatever.

693
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,640
We'll see how that ends up.

694
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:21,400
But it's essentially here.

695
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:25,720
What's less obvious is how these same technologies

696
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:29,360
we use for entertainment are going to make,

697
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:32,480
allow us to have tools that make the real world much

698
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,000
better.

699
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,240
And that's why I'm focusing my energies on all of that stuff

700
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:41,120
because I think it's pretty much a done deal that

701
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,640
will do fun stuff there.

702
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,840
Every time a new kind of computing thing is created,

703
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:49,200
people figure out how to make fun games from it, right?

704
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,440
The very first computers had games.

705
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,280
I think probably they had some game they

706
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:57,080
were running on the ENIAC.

707
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,720
May not a video game, but they created something.

708
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:02,000
They played tic-tac-toe or something on there.

709
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:51,760
But again, I think that's coming

710
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:56,880
to consumer, more social, maybe non-social things as well.

711
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:02,600
I think consumers are the hardest to please, right?

712
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:07,360
You need devices that are exquisite and delightful

713
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:08,520
for consumers.

714
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:11,600
Whereas for a worker in a factory,

715
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:13,280
that's not necessarily the case.

716
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,920
As long as it's useful, if a tool is useful,

717
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:17,920
you can get them to use it.

718
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:19,720
Company can mandate them using it,

719
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:21,880
and that's just part of the job.

720
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:24,480
Whereas if this thing on your head

721
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,000
is a little bit uncomfortable, you're

722
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,920
not going to want to watch TV in there.

723
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,120
You're going to take it off immediately.

724
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:34,960
It also has to be cheap, and it has to be easy,

725
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,720
and everything has to be just great.

726
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,920
So I think it's going to be a while

727
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:44,640
till we get there on the VR and even AR side for consumers.

728
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:49,880
But the industrial side, I think it's useful right now.

729
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:53,720
And I see it every day with Omniverse,

730
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:56,480
the platform my team has been building.

731
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:01,320
I was really surprised at the progression of companies

732
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:04,160
that adopted it early.

733
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,320
I imagined, because we were building on USD

734
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:10,760
and we're coming from traditional computer graphics

735
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:13,960
with games and movies, that the media entertainment

736
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:16,840
industry and gaming would be the first ones

737
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:20,000
to use Omniverse for their things.

738
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,560
And the next I imagined, the next bigger market

739
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:25,800
would be AEC, Architecture, Engineering, and Construction,

740
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,400
and especially the architecture side,

741
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:31,760
which is more visualization and looks more like the M&E side.

742
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,960
And then finally, I thought manufacturing

743
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,320
would be the last one.

744
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,360
Those are probably more like dinosaurs,

745
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,840
last to adopt the technology, but the biggest

746
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:42,880
prize in terms of a large market and the most impact

747
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,280
that it'll make in the world.

748
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:48,040
And the exact opposite has happened.

749
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:52,600
We've sold to maybe 100 different large enterprises

750
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:53,520
already.

751
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:56,000
Most of them are in manufacturing.

752
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,360
And it's completely inverted.

753
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:01,000
So it's companies like BMW, and then companies

754
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,760
I never even thought, I didn't even

755
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:07,040
know about, like Kroger, those supermarkets, and Lowe's.

756
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,680
And well, Nike kind of makes sense.

757
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:14,640
But all of these, there's the Deutsche Bahn,

758
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:17,600
the German railway system.

759
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:21,800
They all need to build digital twins of their systems,

760
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,120
of their products.

761
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:28,320
When we were speaking to BMW originally,

762
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:31,760
they're like, for them, it's an existential problem.

763
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:34,160
They spend tens of billions of dollars,

764
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:38,480
like $30 billion a year on their factories,

765
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:40,680
building new ones and operating their other.

766
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,120
That's a lot of money.

767
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:44,080
And every factory that they build

768
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,320
is getting harder and harder.

769
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:46,920
There's like 6,000, 7,000 people that

770
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:50,800
contribute to the design of a factory over many years.

771
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,840
And inevitably, when they build it,

772
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:55,520
there's a whole bunch of bugs.

773
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,160
Things don't work.

774
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,880
And they have to go rebuild things.

775
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:03,400
And that causes delays, and new costs,

776
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:07,120
and waste, which can be measured in billions of dollars.

777
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:10,240
So this technology that we're talking about,

778
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:14,000
VR, AR, all of that, they want, because they

779
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,760
want those 6,000 people to be working

780
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:20,080
on a virtual version of that factory years

781
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:23,400
before they actually transform the electrons into atoms,

782
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:24,920
into the real world.

783
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,960
And for them, putting on something

784
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:31,640
that's slightly uncomfortable or costs $1,500 or $1 million

785
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:35,560
for a supercomputer that can simulate that

786
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:40,400
is saving them billions of dollars and time to market.

787
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:45,360
And that pattern exists everywhere.

788
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:45,880
Yes.

789
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:18,360
Margin of profit is 2 to the third of 0.

790
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:20,840
The margin of profit here is 2 to the third of 0.

791
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:24,360
Do you think, like, I'm not sure if it is something

792
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:28,320
like that of a whole factory or a whole factory.

793
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:31,040
So do you think that it could be a function

794
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:36,480
that like operates off of a particular technology?

795
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:37,600
Wow.

796
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,680
Sounds like we've got somebody trying to figure out

797
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:44,520
which stocks to invest in right over here.

798
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:46,120
I've got to be careful what I say here.

799
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:52,320
So there were a bunch of questions there.

800
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,600
One is, do I believe the marginal cost of compute

801
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:58,480
and energy are going to zero?

802
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,440
I don't know about compute, but maybe with energy,

803
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:05,920
because we are building new energy systems,

804
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,320
renewable energy.

805
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:09,040
And depending on areas, I think that's

806
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,520
going to be a local question.

807
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:14,160
Some places where you have lots of sun or wind,

808
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:18,640
you'll have effectively free energy.

809
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,720
Other places, maybe not.

810
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:22,600
I don't know about that.

811
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:26,320
As far as compute goes, I don't know if the cost of compute

812
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,200
can ever be zero.

813
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,960
From what we've seen, the cost of building

814
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,600
the computers themselves, the chips and the processors,

815
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,800
that's actually only going up.

816
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:39,240
The science behind creating a modern chip at the scales

817
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:43,480
we're doing it at is staggering.

818
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:47,640
And the cost associated with that is even higher.

819
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:51,160
So I'm not sure that's going to go to zero any time soon.

820
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:54,200
If anything, we'll see.

821
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,400
We just passed the CHIPS Act here.

822
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,760
So there's going to be a lot more foundries and whatnot.

823
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:04,560
Yeah, if you if you measure it purely in terms of, you know,

824
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:08,560
the amount of arithmetic operations you can do,

825
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:12,040
yes, that each arithmetic operation becomes cheaper.

826
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:15,400
But what we've shown is we always have bigger problems

827
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:16,800
to fill that compute with.

828
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,600
So it's not just the cost of computing.

829
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,320
It's the cost of building the computer.

830
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,520
So it's not just the cost of building the computer.

831
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:24,200
It's the cost of building the computer.

832
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:26,400
And it's not just the cost of building the computer.

833
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:28,000
It's the cost of building the computer.

834
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,240
So we always have bigger problems to fill that compute with.

835
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,400
So it's just never enough.

836
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:37,760
And the fixed capacity of computers that we have available to us to run it

837
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,520
is still a finite quantity.

838
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:42,520
We saw this during the pandemic.

839
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,080
You couldn't buy enough computers.

840
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:45,520
Everybody needed them.

841
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:52,120
And both in terms of our devices, but also in the cloud,

842
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:55,640
there was just supply constraints to the amount of computers that are there.

843
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:59,920
So we're at a point where our demand for compute is so great,

844
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:02,360
we can't produce new computers fast enough.

845
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:06,200
So we're going to be using older computers for longer

846
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,160
in order to satisfy that demand.

847
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:09,360
But we'll see.

848
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,040
That's a hard thing to predict.

849
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:16,120
And I wouldn't base any of your stock purchases on anything I just said.

850
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,040
Because I don't know.

851
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:17,920
I'm an engineer.

852
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,600
I'm not a.

853
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:21,100
Yes.

854
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:28,100
So in terms of, you know, you mentioned phase two.

855
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:36,100
So in terms of newer technology, what about when we start talking about the quantum?

856
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:41,100
So, you know, IBM just released their newest quantum chip.

857
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:45,100
You know, there's been all this stuff about quantum entanglement and all that.

858
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:48,100
How does that, you know, where do you see that fitting in

859
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:52,100
I'm not an expert on quantum computing either,

860
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:57,100
but I tangentially know some stuff because I'm at NVIDIA and we're doing a lot there.

861
01:14:57,100 --> 01:15:02,100
My understanding is even when we crack the quantum computing problem,

862
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:05,100
you're still going to need a whole bunch of conventional computers around it.

863
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:08,100
It's not sufficient to just have a quantum computer.

864
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:13,100
You need a lot of normal computers to test the data and the answers and stuff.

865
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:18,100
You need a lot of normal computers to test the data and the answers and stuff coming out of that

866
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:23,100
to make sure that you get the signal out of the noise from this thing.

867
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:24,100
Right.

868
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:27,100
And in terms of building the quantum computers,

869
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:32,100
you still need a conventional computer to verify that the thing actually even works.

870
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:35,100
So we're always going to need conventional computing

871
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:39,100
or some other kind of computing alongside that.

872
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:47,100
Also, there's just a whole bunch of problems that we solve with conventional computers today

873
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:51,100
that I don't think we have quantum algorithms or equivalents for.

874
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:56,100
So for certain things that are, you know, NP complete problems

875
01:15:56,100 --> 01:16:00,100
that we can't use conventional computers for, it's probably going to be perfect for that,

876
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:03,100
but it's going to be part of your system.

877
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:06,100
We're going to have heterogeneous computers,

878
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:10,100
different types of processors, and some of them will be quantum computers

879
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:13,100
that are just part of the system.

880
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:26,100
I don't even have to do part two, but you want me to? Is that right?

881
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:30,100
I could just show some of the videos, but why don't we take one more question?

882
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:36,100
Question about what? Rendering. Yes. My favorite topic.

883
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:12,100
Okay. So the question was, a few years ago, about three years ago,

884
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:17,100
NVIDIA said that the future of real-time gaming graphics from rendering

885
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:21,100
is going to be path tracing in 2025.

886
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:26,100
35. We said that? I don't know who said that exactly,

887
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:30,100
but we just showed ReSTIR, the ReSTIR algorithm,

888
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:34,100
and some other advancements in real-time path tracing,

889
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:37,100
the spastic graph, so it looks like it's happening earlier.

890
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:41,100
I'm not sure that was said exactly, the 2035.

891
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:46,100
It also depends on how you define what real-time path tracing means.

892
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:50,100
If you talk about path tracing with the number of samples

893
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:53,100
that we typically do in an offline renderer,

894
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:56,100
like the Hyperion renderer somebody had mentioned,

895
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:59,100
or you were talking about earlier, Walt Disney animation,

896
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:04,100
or one of those, we're probably not going to do that many samples

897
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:09,100
in real-time, even by 2035, because they can afford

898
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:13,100
to have a computer run for days to render that one frame.

899
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:17,100
That's a lot of samples in very general.

900
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:22,100
However, the algorithms that we're advancing,

901
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:27,100
that we're inventing for real-time hold a lot of promise,

902
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:29,100
especially when we combine it with machine learning

903
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:33,100
or machine learning style optimizations,

904
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:35,100
and ReSTIR is one of those things.

905
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:40,100
I think, to some extent, we already have real-time path tracing today.

906
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:44,100
It's just for a subset of things that you can do.

907
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:50,100
You can't do all of the things an offline path tracer does in real-time.

908
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:53,100
If you look at the Omniverse renderer,

909
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:57,100
we have two modes inside the Omniverse renderer.

910
01:18:57,100 --> 01:19:01,100
We have what we call real-time and one that's called interactive.

911
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:05,100
The real-time mode essentially breaks the rendering equation

912
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:09,100
down into the different terms, does multiple passes,

913
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:12,100
where it can do denoising on the passes separately

914
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:15,100
before it combines these terms together.

915
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:17,100
It's still path tracing,

916
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:23,100
even though it's a subset of the rendering equation,

917
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:28,100
but it can do a lot of the normal effects you would get from path tracing.

918
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:32,100
The interactive path tracer is more a traditional-style,

919
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:35,100
unidirectional path tracer,

920
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:39,100
and that one uses an AI-based denoiser to denoise,

921
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:43,100
and it's almost real-time in most cases.

922
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:46,100
On the new 4090 cards we released,

923
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:50,100
it's often actually real-time, depending on how you define real-time,

924
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:54,100
if 20, 30 frames per second is real-time for you or not.

925
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:56,100
Okay?

926
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:58,100
Okay, one more.

927
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:12,100
One more.

928
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:29,100
Really, really good question.

929
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:33,100
This is actually a good question to lead up into the next thing I'm going to show.

930
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:36,100
The question was, is Omniverse,

931
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:39,100
the platform that we're building,

932
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:42,100
primarily for industrial use,

933
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:45,100
or will it also be useful for other things?

934
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:49,100
Actually, we built it so that it's useful for all things.

935
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:52,100
In general, NVIDIA, as a company,

936
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:56,100
our product is technology.

937
01:20:56,100 --> 01:21:00,100
We're a pure technology company.

938
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:03,100
You can say there's a lot of great technology companies out there,

939
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:06,100
but not all of them are pure technology companies,

940
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:09,100
and by pure I mean where your product,

941
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:12,100
your bottom, the earnings reports you have,

942
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:16,100
shows that you're making money from selling just technology.

943
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:20,100
Most of these other technology companies, they sell ads,

944
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:24,100
they sell other things, and the technology is a means to that end.

945
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:27,100
What we do is we build core tech, we build chips,

946
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:30,100
we build systems, we build system software stacks,

947
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:33,100
we build algorithms infused into libraries,

948
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:36,100
we build platforms like Omniverse,

949
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:40,100
that by themselves don't actually do that much.

950
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:43,100
It's kind of useless.

951
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:46,100
What's a computer without an application on it?

952
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:49,100
It's just technology.

953
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:52,100
But other people can then take this technology stack

954
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:56,100
and go build an application, a workflow, a solution for someone else.

955
01:21:57,100 --> 01:22:02,100
Our strategy is to build special computers

956
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:06,100
that accelerate problems that are really, really hard to solve

957
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:11,100
and make it as general as possible, but not too general.

958
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:15,100
If it's too general, then it becomes a CPU,

959
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:18,100
and then it's not going to be great

960
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:21,100
at the types of problems we care to solve.

961
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:24,100
But if it's too specific, then we're too limited in our markets.

962
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:27,100
So we build all of our stacks

963
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:30,100
so that it can be applicable to as many domains as possible.

964
01:22:30,100 --> 01:22:35,100
So we see Omniverse as being a technology stack

965
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:38,100
that can apply to many industries,

966
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:41,100
and fundamentally, by itself, it's actually not doing that much.

967
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:43,100
In some cases, we provide examples,

968
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:45,100
but we've designed it so others can take it

969
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:47,100
and integrate it into their systems.

970
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:51,100
So what is Omniverse, then, would be the next question.

971
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:54,100
It's essentially two things for us,

972
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:57,100
two things that we needed to solve our problems.

973
01:22:57,100 --> 01:23:02,100
So years ago, when we started working on advancing AI

974
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:05,100
for robotics, for self-driving cars,

975
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:09,100
we're building our own self-driving cars,

976
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:12,100
the full stack, the computer, the brain,

977
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:16,100
everything that we then license to big car companies

978
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:21,100
like Mercedes and Jaguar, Land Rover, and so on and so forth.

979
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:25,100
We realized we needed a simulator,

980
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:29,100
and we need to do a type of simulation

981
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:33,100
that just nobody else was doing.

982
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:36,100
We needed an extremely high-fidelity simulation

983
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:42,100
that could produce everything that every sensor on our cars can see,

984
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:45,100
so all of the cameras, lidars, and radars,

985
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:47,100
and we need to do it with hardware in the loop.

986
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:50,100
So we want to take the brain of the car

987
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:54,100
and replace the sensor input connectors

988
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:57,100
with the output from our GPUs directly

989
01:23:57,100 --> 01:24:00,100
so we can put this brain in a virtual reality,

990
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:03,100
and it has to run at exactly in real time,

991
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:06,100
at the same timing it would in the real world.

992
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:09,100
Otherwise, our testing of it would be invalid.

993
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:12,100
If we slowed down the simulator

994
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:17,100
and slowed down the brain of the computer,

995
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:21,100
that wouldn't be an accurate test to how it would behave in the real world.

996
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:23,100
We need to test that correctly.

997
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:27,100
And so to build this, we needed two things.

998
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:29,100
First, we need to actually build the world.

999
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:33,100
We need cities. We need roads. We need pedestrians.

1000
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:37,100
We need all of the cars that are in these roads.

1001
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:41,100
We need all of the material properties and the physical properties

1002
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:44,100
of everything to be accurate inside this world.

1003
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:48,100
We need to be able to simulate the visible light spectrum,

1004
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:53,100
lidar, radar, sounds, everything inside this world,

1005
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:55,100
and we need to be able to do it in real time.

1006
01:24:55,100 --> 01:25:00,100
And it should be arbitrarily complex and large and real time.

1007
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:03,100
So to do that, we first said, well,

1008
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:05,100
we need a way to aggregate all the information

1009
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:07,100
that already exists in the world.

1010
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:11,100
We have information from geospatial databases.

1011
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:13,100
There's information about roads.

1012
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:18,100
There's information about buildings that are in tools like Revit and ArcaCAD.

1013
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:21,100
Designers use CAD tools to create these buildings.

1014
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:27,100
Every piece of furniture has some CAD design somewhere.

1015
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:31,100
How do we take all this data and put it into one thing

1016
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:33,100
that we can then feed into the simulator?

1017
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:37,100
That was USD, and then we built a whole bunch of stuff around it.

1018
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:43,100
So if USD is our HTML, then we needed the equivalent of like a web server.

1019
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:44,100
What's the HTTP and all that?

1020
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:46,100
So we built that with Omniverse.

1021
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:47,100
We call it Nucleus.

1022
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:49,100
This is the database that the world lives in,

1023
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:54,100
and then protocols to be able to interactively experience

1024
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:59,100
the state of the world inside that in a live way.

1025
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:02,100
Once we had that, then we need the actual simulator.

1026
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:08,100
How do you run a real-time simulation of an extremely high-fidelity world?

1027
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:11,100
We first actually tried to use game engines for this purpose.

1028
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:13,100
We took Unreal Engine.

1029
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:15,100
We have a great relationship with Epic,

1030
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:20,100
and we have a huge team of engineers dedicated to optimizing Unreal Engine

1031
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:22,100
and adding cool features to it.

1032
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:24,100
So we said, why don't we use this?

1033
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:28,100
Because basically, a game engine is a world simulator.

1034
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:30,100
Let's try that.

1035
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:36,100
And after a while, we found even though theoretically they're the same,

1036
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:40,100
there's some really fundamental differences between a game engine

1037
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:45,100
and a simulator that you need for the kinds of purposes we had.

1038
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:51,100
One of them is that with a game, being physically accurate

1039
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:58,100
is not only not necessary, it's often an anti-feature.

1040
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:04,100
If you want to make a fun game, you're often breaking the laws of physics.

1041
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:09,100
You have superpowers and magic and things like that.

1042
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:13,100
A game developer has to recoup their investment,

1043
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:17,100
which means they need to be able to sell their game to many gamers,

1044
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:22,100
which means it has to run on many types of computers and small computers.

1045
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:27,100
Game engines are designed to run on phones, on consoles,

1046
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:33,100
on maybe a high-end gaming PC, but they're really optimized

1047
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:38,100
for running on the lowest common denominator kind of system.

1048
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:41,100
And what you'll give up when you're going to make your game run

1049
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:46,100
on as many devices as possible is physical accuracy and fidelity.

1050
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:49,100
You'll reduce the detail level of the worlds.

1051
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:54,100
You'll cheat on all of the physics algorithms, on the rendering,

1052
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:57,100
on everything to make it run everywhere possible.

1053
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:59,100
But we needed to do the opposite.

1054
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:03,100
We're like, we need this base level of fidelity and quality,

1055
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:06,100
and we need it to be real-time. We can't sacrifice that.

1056
01:28:06,100 --> 01:28:08,100
So we're willing to throw more compute at it.

1057
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:12,100
We can throw more GPUs and actually even more nodes.

1058
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:16,100
We can have many, many computers with many GPUs all working as one,

1059
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:22,100
but none of the game engines allow you to harness that computing power.

1060
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:25,100
And so we tried to make the game engines actually do that,

1061
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:29,100
to scale to many GPUs, many nodes, so we could drive a hardware

1062
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:32,100
in the loop simulator, and we finally couldn't.

1063
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:34,100
We're like, that doesn't work.

1064
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:38,100
The other problem is the authoring pipelines for game engines

1065
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:44,100
are designed around this pattern of having a large team of artists

1066
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:48,100
hyper-optimize the content to distribute to the lowest

1067
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:51,100
common denominator computer.

1068
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:56,100
They make the assets run on a PlayStation, on Xbox.

1069
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:58,100
They design to that.

1070
01:28:58,100 --> 01:29:00,100
Whereas we want the opposite of that.

1071
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:05,100
We want to be able to take the highest fidelity designs and content,

1072
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:08,100
the actual real-world data that we've captured,

1073
01:29:08,100 --> 01:29:12,100
and just simulate that, and not have to have a team of artists

1074
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:16,100
do a transformation of the data into something that a game engine can take.

1075
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:19,100
But we're willing to throw more compute at it to solve that problem.

1076
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:22,100
So if you can scale up, you can do this.

1077
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:27,100
So we built these two things, a system to aggregate the worlds

1078
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:31,100
that you could then feed into any simulator, including a game engine,

1079
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:35,100
because we've connected Unreal Engine, and now we're connecting Unity to it,

1080
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:40,100
and maybe O3DE, the open-source one in the Linux Foundation.

1081
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:45,100
But we built this special simulation stack that can scale up,

1082
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:49,100
and built from the ground up a new kind of renderer.

1083
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:52,100
The one I was talking about is the only pure ray-tracing real-time renderer

1084
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:54,100
there is, as far as I know.

1085
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:59,100
We have VR in pure ray-traced VR, something nobody else is doing.

1086
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:02,100
And nobody else would, because we started developing this

1087
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:07,100
back when the install base of ray-traced GPUs was zero.

1088
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:11,100
Before we released our Turing generation in 2018,

1089
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:13,100
we had started working on this.

1090
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:18,100
And no game developer would do that, because it would be insanity

1091
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:21,100
to develop software for computers that don't exist.

1092
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:24,100
We can do it, because we know what computers we're building,

1093
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:26,100
and it's in our interest to do that.

1094
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:28,100
So we built this stack for that purpose.

1095
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:34,100
And I believe one day somebody will make an awesome game on top of this.

1096
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:36,100
I don't think it's going to be me, unfortunately,

1097
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:38,100
because I'm too busy building other stuff.

1098
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:41,100
And Jensen, my boss, won't let me.

1099
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:45,100
He won't let me build a game as much as I want to go do that.

1100
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:47,100
We built little gaming experiences.

1101
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:53,100
We showed RacerX demo at the last keynote, if you guys check it out.

1102
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:57,100
We had Marbles demo a few years back.

1103
01:30:57,100 --> 01:30:59,100
That was done by my group.

1104
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:02,100
So you can use it for these kinds of things.

1105
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:05,100
But until most of the computes in the cloud,

1106
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:08,100
I don't think it makes sense to release a production game like this,

1107
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:14,100
because it's going to require expensive computers that most consumers don't have.

1108
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:17,100
OK, so that was a very long answer to your question.

1109
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:21,100
I hope it was sufficient.

1110
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:24,100
Let me show you a few examples of Omniverse.

1111
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:28,100
I will try to erase this, because I know I've been babbling for a while.

1112
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:49,100
So I mentioned that Omniverse is a platform, and it lets you do a lot of things.

1113
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:58,100
But one of the fundamental things it does is it lets you take whatever tools you use in your domain

1114
01:31:58,100 --> 01:32:06,100
and combine your expertise with your tools into a singular virtual world.

1115
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:12,100
That's the composition of all of the data from your other team members.

1116
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:18,100
So here's an example that some of our experts internally at NVIDIA put together.

1117
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:27,100
We have some architects that work for us that we hired to show what Omniverse can do.

1118
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:36,100
First, you can go download Omniverse, all of you, as long as you have a fairly recent NVIDIA GPU.

1119
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:39,100
You can use the rendering, even without the rendering.

1120
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:46,100
You can use the connectors and Nucleus and all this other stuff without it.

1121
01:32:46,100 --> 01:32:50,100
Just go to, if you search for NVIDIA Omniverse, it'll come up.

1122
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:53,100
What's scrolling here was our launcher, which has all the software.

1123
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:58,100
It's free for individuals and students and all of that.

1124
01:32:58,100 --> 01:33:04,100
And if you guys wanted any of the enterprise stuff here, you guys know some people, so we can get you access.

1125
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:08,100
Let's see.

1126
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:14,100
Yeah, so they put together this really, really amazing workflow, this design story.

1127
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:16,100
So let me talk you through some of this.

1128
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:18,100
This is Revit.

1129
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:23,100
It's a very popular tool with architects to build buildings.

1130
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:32,100
So you can see the architects designed the bones of the building, the kind of skeleton of it.

1131
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:39,100
And with our connector that we built, we have a whole bunch of connectors for all these different tools.

1132
01:33:39,100 --> 01:33:43,100
And now the tools makers themselves are building connectors to Omniverse.

1133
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:48,100
We can bring it into Omniverse, and this is our interactive mode of the renderer I was telling you about.

1134
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:51,100
So it's path tracing in near real time.

1135
01:33:51,100 --> 01:34:00,100
I can see him kind of moving around in there and see what it looks like and see what the floor plan and everything looks like in there.

1136
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:12,100
All of the BIM data, the information about the building materials and metadata also comes through Revit.

1137
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:13,100
So it's there in place.

1138
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:15,100
It's not just the visuals.

1139
01:34:17,100 --> 01:34:20,100
And then this is SketchUp.

1140
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:30,100
So an interior designer who's more comfortable with SketchUp than Revit can go design a few apartment layouts and the interiors of those apartments in there.

1141
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:41,100
And because we have a SketchUp connector as well, they can quickly connect to our Nucleus server and live bring that in into Omniverse.

1142
01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:46,100
And here you see it with more accurate lighting.

1143
01:34:46,100 --> 01:34:55,100
We can simulate what those materials and lighting would actually look like in the real world for the different rooms.

1144
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:57,100
All right.

1145
01:34:57,100 --> 01:35:02,100
And so here's another tool, Rhino, which is used in manufacturing.

1146
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:17,100
But also a lot of architects like to use this along with a procedural graph-based low-code tool called Grasshopper to procedurally generate things that could end up in a building.

1147
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:31,100
So here they've put together a little graph-based program to randomize the distribution of the different styles of apartments, the interiors, throughout the building.

1148
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:39,100
And yeah, you can see they can choose different ratios for the different mixtures of buildings.

1149
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:44,100
And at the end, we're going to see them publish it into Omniverse.

1150
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:50,100
Oh, I can see here.

1151
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:53,100
I don't have to crank my neck up.

1152
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:57,100
Oh, did it start over? Okay.

1153
01:35:58,100 --> 01:35:59,100
All right.

1154
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:04,100
And so here we have an asset swap.

1155
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:11,100
Rhino can't handle all of the detail that SketchUp provides for the interiors.

1156
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:18,100
So within Rhino, we just use blocks, like a very low-level LOD, to represent it.

1157
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:29,100
But once we aggregate it into USD and Omniverse, we can switch out the blocks with the SketchUp interior data.

1158
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:32,100
So within Omniverse, everything gets composed.

1159
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:35,100
You can see on the left side, we have Rhino representation.

1160
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:42,100
And in Omniverse, we have the interiors swapped in from SketchUp directly.

1161
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:46,100
And then it could actually be placed inside the building structure.

1162
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:49,100
So we're composing the whole building with the different apartment types.

1163
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:52,100
All in there and seeing it all as one.

1164
01:36:53,100 --> 01:37:04,100
So throughout this workflow, what's amazing about this USD workflow is at any given time, you have a view of the designed world as is.

1165
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:07,100
A source of truth of everything combined together.

1166
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:15,100
So anyone on the team or even the customer or client can jump in, jump in in VR or AR or whatever,

1167
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:19,100
and experience what the whole thing looks like together.

1168
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:21,100
Usually, this is all done in isolation.

1169
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:27,100
Every person working on the building is working in their own tools,

1170
01:37:27,100 --> 01:37:33,100
and they can only show them something in their own isolated little worlds.

1171
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:39,100
USD has another great concept called variance.

1172
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:48,100
So for every primitive or every object inside the scene graph, you can create multiple variants.

1173
01:37:48,100 --> 01:37:50,100
It's not limited to the objects or geometry.

1174
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:53,100
It's any properties can be variants.

1175
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:55,100
So these are all set up.

1176
01:37:55,100 --> 01:38:05,100
Essentially, you end up with a kind of building configurator or configurator application that's all data-driven.

1177
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:08,100
The designers can just stick those variants in there.

1178
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:16,100
And here they wrote a little extension in Omniverse that shows them the apartment mix with a nice little graph right in place.

1179
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:19,100
All composed together.

1180
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:30,100
So now you have the facade designer who's creating different facade variants in Rhino, Rhino and Grasshopper.

1181
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:36,100
And they can bring all these variants into the variant creator.

1182
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:39,100
They're just dragging and dropping the different ones.

1183
01:38:43,100 --> 01:38:46,100
And you can see the interactive path tracer up there.

1184
01:38:46,100 --> 01:38:54,100
With the whole scene, just switching the variants for the facades out and getting immediate response.

1185
01:38:54,100 --> 01:39:01,100
So the designer can see what it's going to look like with the different variants in the lighting,

1186
01:39:01,100 --> 01:39:05,100
in that geolocation at that moment in time.

1187
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:08,100
Downstairs, there's a bar restaurant.

1188
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:12,100
So this was designed mostly in Rhino as well.

1189
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:17,100
And so the restaurant designer can export their restaurant.

1190
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:23,100
And just with our connector, it immediately already has some materials and stuff.

1191
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:26,100
As good as the CAD tool provides.

1192
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:34,100
But you can go in there and replace them with the material libraries we provide.

1193
01:39:34,100 --> 01:39:38,100
Our open source materials based on the material definition language.

1194
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:47,100
Which is a system we built and open sourced many years ago for describing physically accurate materials that are energy conserving.

1195
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:50,100
And you can see I'm applying them there.

1196
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:54,100
We also have an AI-based search tool we call DeepSearch.

1197
01:39:54,100 --> 01:40:03,100
That can search through the whole database of items that we have on our Nucleus server for objects.

1198
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:07,100
So you can see I'm searching for glassware.

1199
01:40:07,100 --> 01:40:13,100
And it's using a natural language-based model to do the search.

1200
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:17,100
You don't have to tag any of these assets or anything.

1201
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:29,100
It understands them in the same way all of the recent natural language and generative AI stuff we've been seeing on images work.

1202
01:40:30,100 --> 01:40:36,100
So you can start assembling the scene from all the pieces.

1203
01:40:36,100 --> 01:40:40,100
And then we can play around with the interiors here.

1204
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:48,100
So in Grasshopper, they've made a procedure for that thing at the ceiling.

1205
01:40:48,100 --> 01:40:49,100
I don't know what it's called.

1206
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:50,100
But there's like flutes on it.

1207
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:55,100
So they can change the depth and width of the flutes.

1208
01:40:56,100 --> 01:41:10,100
And immediately see in context with the lighting that would be accurate for that geolocation at that point in time in the year what it would look like.

1209
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:19,100
So they don't have to guess at whether it's going to look good or not throughout the year and with different lighting conditions.

1210
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:29,100
You can just check it immediately because our rendering is actually a simulation of how light would interact with matter.

1211
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:36,100
Let's see.

1212
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:41,100
Yeah, they can cycle through different variants and more of that.

1213
01:41:41,100 --> 01:41:43,100
And then produce some images.

1214
01:41:43,100 --> 01:41:53,100
And here we have another renderer called IRAE, which is a hyper-physically accurate renderer that's energy conserving.

1215
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:56,100
It can do caustics, bidirectional, all of that stuff.

1216
01:41:56,100 --> 01:42:10,100
And so we can create an image here that is essentially the radiance or the energy level at each point on the surface.

1217
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:25,100
So we can tell how much light is going to arrive at each point in the real world to deal with the cooling systems and the positioning of the windows and the angles of the windows and all of that.

1218
01:42:25,100 --> 01:42:27,100
So we don't fry the humans that are sitting in there.

1219
01:42:30,100 --> 01:42:36,100
And then for the outside, we can take another tool, 3ds Max, and connect it into this world.

1220
01:42:37,100 --> 01:42:41,100
We can drop some of the assets that we include with Omniverse for trees.

1221
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:47,100
And you can see 3ds Max on the left side and Omniverse Create on the right.

1222
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:50,100
They're both live connected into the same world.

1223
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:51,100
So you can choose.

1224
01:42:51,100 --> 01:42:54,100
Multiple people could be working at the same time.

1225
01:42:54,100 --> 01:43:00,100
It's essentially like Minecraft, except you're not limited to one meter cubed voxels.

1226
01:43:01,100 --> 01:43:07,100
You can edit anything inside the world from any tool that has an Omniverse connection.

1227
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:16,100
All right, and so now we're checking out the different facades with the trees and stuff there.

1228
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:22,100
And we can bring in another tool to give us some more context.

1229
01:43:22,100 --> 01:43:26,100
This is Esri City Engine.

1230
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:37,100
So we can create some geotypical buildings based on the actual location and place this building in context to see what it would look like properly.

1231
01:43:37,100 --> 01:43:47,100
So we take City Engine, generate the buildings around it, and then those export as USD as well.

1232
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:53,100
And we can bring it into Omniverse and it renders much more beautifully.

1233
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:57,100
With our real-time path tracing.

1234
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:02,100
And that's the location we're going to place it.

1235
01:44:02,100 --> 01:44:08,100
And we can use Grasshopper again to do some generative AI.

1236
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:23,100
Essentially, explore the space of possible angles and configurations of the building to see how it would be affected by the sun and what heating and cooling might be an issue there.

1237
01:44:23,100 --> 01:44:27,100
Also, put it in a wind tunnel.

1238
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:30,100
Apparently, this is really important in designing cities.

1239
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:37,100
Wind in many cities matters and the orientation of the building matters a lot.

1240
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:47,100
So we can run a CFD simulation with the different variants of the building configuration and optimize for energy consumption and whatnot.

1241
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:50,100
And we can also go experience this.

1242
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:54,100
So here we have the city from City Engine.

1243
01:45:02,100 --> 01:45:06,100
And I think they're using SimScale for the CFD.

1244
01:45:06,100 --> 01:45:21,100
So it's running its simulation and then we can export the data from that to bring in the streamlines from the CFD simulator into Omniverse so you can visualize it.

1245
01:45:29,100 --> 01:45:32,100
You end up with an image like that, which is kind of cool.

1246
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:37,100
And you can see it animated over time.

1247
01:45:37,100 --> 01:45:44,100
And we can take this whole system and view it using our renderer.

1248
01:45:44,100 --> 01:45:47,100
Let's stream those pixels to any device.

1249
01:45:47,100 --> 01:45:52,100
On the bottom right here, what you're seeing is a display on an iPad.

1250
01:45:52,100 --> 01:46:17,100
And because the iPad can track itself using ARKit, using SLAM, we can send that pose of the iPad back as a camera inside our world and do the rendering on a server, stream the rendering back to the iPad so it looks like it's a window into that world.

1251
01:46:17,100 --> 01:46:20,100
You can kind of place it on a tabletop.

1252
01:46:21,100 --> 01:46:23,100
We can do this with VR as well.

1253
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:43,100
These are different waypoints.

1254
01:46:43,100 --> 01:46:44,100
All right. Ended there.

1255
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:55,100
Anyway, this just shows in the creation of this one world for the design of a building in a city, there were many, many tools used.

1256
01:46:55,100 --> 01:47:01,100
And these people were all working simultaneously on different parts of the building.

1257
01:47:01,100 --> 01:47:05,100
But we could see the composition of all of them together.

1258
01:47:05,100 --> 01:47:07,100
This is invaluable.

1259
01:47:07,100 --> 01:47:15,100
Today, most of the things we build, they're designed in pieces and we don't get to integrate them together until it's very late.

1260
01:47:15,100 --> 01:47:17,100
And it's very costly to make any changes.

1261
01:47:17,100 --> 01:47:31,100
So we often have to be very conservative with the design decisions we make because we're not sure if the design, the aggressive thing we want to do is going to work or not.

1262
01:47:31,100 --> 01:47:46,100
But if you could see it in context combined with all of the elements others are bringing into the design, you could be more certain that you're making a good decision and build better things.

1263
01:47:46,100 --> 01:47:52,100
So here are all the different tools that were used for the different parts of creating this world.

1264
01:47:52,100 --> 01:47:58,100
City engine, pair of you, yeah, there's just a ton of them.

1265
01:47:58,100 --> 01:48:03,100
All right, so that's that for Omniverse.

1266
01:48:03,100 --> 01:48:05,100
I don't know how you guys want to do this.

1267
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:11,100
I can go for longer if you guys want and answer a few questions.

1268
01:48:11,100 --> 01:48:15,100
Do a little more Q&A.

1269
01:48:15,100 --> 01:48:18,100
Sure.

1270
01:48:18,100 --> 01:48:43,100
All right, there was a question here.

1271
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:48,100
Right.

1272
01:48:48,100 --> 01:48:52,100
So many of the connectors are bidirectional, but some are not.

1273
01:48:52,100 --> 01:48:54,100
It just depends on which one.

1274
01:48:54,100 --> 01:49:03,100
Our dream is that eventually everyone uses a USD compatible representation for their internal scene graph.

1275
01:49:03,100 --> 01:49:09,100
We're in this transition period where most tools are not built on top of USD.

1276
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:11,100
Actually, very few are.

1277
01:49:11,100 --> 01:49:25,100
Basically, just Omniverse and Pixar's internal tools are built on that, which is fine because all great systems always start with legacy pieces that are actually very valuable.

1278
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:32,100
There's a lot of great tools out there, and there's a reason people use them for the purpose they use them for.

1279
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:38,100
We don't want to force everyone to change the tools they're already using.

1280
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:49,100
So the compromise is we have to do a conversion from the internal representation of the data inside those tools to USD and back.

1281
01:49:49,100 --> 01:50:04,100
When we started on this many years ago, most of these companies like McNeil, who does Rhino, and Autodesk, they hadn't even heard of USD, at least for those tools.

1282
01:50:04,100 --> 01:50:05,100
So they didn't care about it.

1283
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:08,100
But we said, we're going to go prime the pump.

1284
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:24,100
We went and built connectors and did the best job we could with the APIs they provide us to do that translation back and forth, waiting for when they would finally take it over and provide a USD translation back and forth themselves.

1285
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:27,100
Fortunately, that started to happen this past year.

1286
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:31,100
We've been seeing not just interest, but just straight up adoption.

1287
01:50:31,100 --> 01:50:33,100
They're doing it themselves.

1288
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:40,100
And so the more and more they support USD, the more natural that connection back and forth is going to be.

1289
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:48,100
In the interim period, some tools have higher fidelity USD support than others.

1290
01:50:48,100 --> 01:50:51,100
And in some cases, it doesn't matter that much.

1291
01:50:51,100 --> 01:50:56,100
You don't necessarily need to have bidirectional connectivity with all tools.

1292
01:50:56,100 --> 01:51:01,100
Some tools are just sources that push stuff.

1293
01:51:01,100 --> 01:51:04,100
They don't need to bring much data back.

1294
01:51:04,100 --> 01:51:09,100
It just depends on the particular workflow.

1295
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:24,100
Any other questions for somebody?

1296
01:51:24,100 --> 01:51:26,100
We're doing plenty of that, too.

1297
01:51:26,100 --> 01:51:32,100
If I showed you everything we're working on, we'll be here for a few weeks.

1298
01:51:32,100 --> 01:51:36,100
There's a ton of stuff online you should check out.

1299
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:44,100
And every one of our GTC keynotes in the past few years, Jensen is showing kinds of Omniverse stuff.

1300
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:48,100
One recurring character we've had is Toy Jensen.

1301
01:51:48,100 --> 01:51:50,100
Have you guys seen this?

1302
01:51:50,100 --> 01:51:55,100
So that's all done in Omniverse, and it's powered by the AIs that we're creating.

1303
01:51:55,100 --> 01:51:58,100
We have some really photorealistic humans as well.

1304
01:51:58,100 --> 01:52:10,100
We have a whole digital human team in my group that is trying to actually simulate humans, including everything on the inside as well,

1305
01:52:10,100 --> 01:52:21,100
muscles and everything about them, because we need to generate synthetic data for perception systems that involve humans.

1306
01:52:22,100 --> 01:52:24,100
One example is inside cars.

1307
01:52:24,100 --> 01:52:31,100
In the cockpit of a car, there are sensors now that detect when you're falling asleep or something wrong is going on in there.

1308
01:52:31,100 --> 01:52:33,100
We need data to train them.

1309
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:41,100
So we're generating humans to go generate the data to go train those perception systems as we speak.

1310
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:48,100
And we find that most of our customers need humans for various things.

1311
01:52:48,100 --> 01:52:58,100
BMW needs to put factory workers inside their digital twins and test the ergonomics of the factory.

1312
01:52:58,100 --> 01:53:09,100
Deutsche Bahn, who operates all of the trains in Germany, they really care a lot about the crowds on their platforms and keeping them safe.

1313
01:53:09,100 --> 01:53:20,100
And so they need to model what crowds behave like and train the perception systems they have for their cameras there to find behavior that's not dangerous

1314
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:24,100
or that's too dangerous and go correct it, things like this.

1315
01:53:24,100 --> 01:53:25,100
So you can check it out.

1316
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:36,100
We have a ton of talks at our GTC in our GTC On Demand videos that go into all of the stuff we're doing with humans.

1317
01:53:36,100 --> 01:53:37,100
I have a question.

1318
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:41,100
Could you follow up on that?

1319
01:53:41,100 --> 01:53:48,100
Do you think at some point, people are going to have to get rid of trash at the top?

1320
01:53:48,100 --> 01:53:56,100
Because if you could perfectly simulate every car crashing, and the ingredients are different than mine, then you're not going to get rid of it.

1321
01:53:56,100 --> 01:54:04,100
I don't know if we'll completely get rid of it, because there's nothing like, you know, real-world simulator, God simulator.

1322
01:54:04,100 --> 01:54:08,100
We'll have to be sure at some point, but I think it'll reduce the number we do.

1323
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:17,100
Simulation allows us to do much more than what you can do in the real life, just because the cost or the limitations.

1324
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:21,100
There's only a certain amount of space and time we have in the real world here.

1325
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:25,100
The virtual world, it's only limited by the amount of compute you have.

1326
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:28,100
But something like a car crash is really, really hard to simulate.

1327
01:54:28,100 --> 01:54:32,100
The physics behind that is very tricky.

1328
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:40,100
And as a result, trusting it, things revolving around safety, you have to be absolutely certain.

1329
01:54:40,100 --> 01:54:46,100
So I think you're always going to end up validating it with real-world crash tests.

1330
01:54:46,100 --> 01:54:52,100
But there's things you can do in a crash test in the virtual world that you can't do in the real world, because it'd be unethical.

1331
01:54:52,100 --> 01:54:54,100
Like, we wouldn't put a real baby in a crash.

1332
01:54:54,100 --> 01:54:56,100
I hope not, in a crash test simulator.

1333
01:54:56,100 --> 01:54:58,100
But you could do that in the virtual world.

1334
01:54:58,100 --> 01:55:04,100
We can put a squishy little baby in there and see what happens.

1335
01:55:04,100 --> 01:55:20,100
Yes?

1336
01:55:20,100 --> 01:55:22,100
Materials are a very, very complex subject.

1337
01:55:22,100 --> 01:55:29,100
And I think they end up being often oversimplified to the point that it's like this one-dimensional thing.

1338
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:36,100
And just the phrasing of that, MDL versus Material X, assumes that they're both trying to do the same thing and they're somehow competing.

1339
01:55:36,100 --> 01:55:41,100
They're actually very different and compatible as a result.

1340
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:45,100
You can think of material systems as a stack.

1341
01:55:45,100 --> 01:55:53,100
And what Material X does is it defines a standard set of nodes you could use to create a material graph from.

1342
01:55:53,100 --> 01:55:57,100
But the implementation of each node is not defined by Material X.

1343
01:55:57,100 --> 01:56:01,100
You have to go implement it for each target system renderer.

1344
01:56:01,100 --> 01:56:07,100
If it's HLSL, GLSL, OSL, and whatnot.

1345
01:56:07,100 --> 01:56:18,100
MDL is a material definition language that is actually hyper-focused on physical accuracy.

1346
01:56:18,100 --> 01:56:21,100
It doesn't define any nodes or any particular things.

1347
01:56:21,100 --> 01:56:26,100
So you can go implement Material X nodes with MDL.

1348
01:56:26,100 --> 01:56:36,100
But it can compile to many other languages like HLSL, GLSL, OSL, C++, CUDA, so on and so forth.

1349
01:56:36,100 --> 01:56:38,100
So you can combine the two there.

1350
01:56:38,100 --> 01:56:40,100
But MDL does something else.

1351
01:56:40,100 --> 01:56:43,100
It's constrained to physical accuracy.

1352
01:56:43,100 --> 01:56:51,100
So it's about energy conservation and bidirectionality in the BSDF models.

1353
01:56:51,100 --> 01:56:54,100
And all of this stuff is assumed in there.

1354
01:56:54,100 --> 01:56:57,100
It's constraining you to only do two things.

1355
01:56:57,100 --> 01:56:59,100
You can only do two things, really.

1356
01:56:59,100 --> 01:57:05,100
Define what the light transport is in your material at a given point.

1357
01:57:05,100 --> 01:57:10,100
And patterns that allow you to parameterize different aspects of this light transport.

1358
01:57:10,100 --> 01:57:12,100
That's the two things that it does.

1359
01:57:12,100 --> 01:57:18,100
And because it only does that and it's a language specified to that, it's not really Turing complete.

1360
01:57:18,100 --> 01:57:23,100
It's not a shading language where you can write any kind of program.

1361
01:57:23,100 --> 01:57:28,100
You can only write programs that define materials that are physically accurate.

1362
01:57:28,100 --> 01:57:35,100
And the compiler, as well as other systems we've built around it, could do transformations to that material

1363
01:57:35,100 --> 01:57:39,100
to target different types of renderers with different algorithms.

1364
01:57:39,100 --> 01:57:48,100
Something you couldn't do naturally from just an arbitrary shader to do various approximations and such.

1365
01:57:48,100 --> 01:57:52,100
So recently, we had open sourced MDL years ago.

1366
01:57:53,100 --> 01:58:02,100
We recently also open sourced what we call the distiller, where we can take a complex material

1367
01:58:02,100 --> 01:58:07,100
that's designed for an offline simulation class renderer

1368
01:58:07,100 --> 01:58:15,100
and distill it to an approximation for a real-time renderer like a game engine.

1369
01:58:15,100 --> 01:58:21,100
And that's the kind of transformation you just can't do with any other material system out there.

1370
01:58:21,100 --> 01:58:27,100
We have an implementation of MaterialX in Omniverse that's built on MDL.

1371
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:33,100
No, it's in MDL, and we're looking to extend MDL.

1372
01:58:33,100 --> 01:58:40,100
It already, essentially, implicitly supports any wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum.

1373
01:58:40,100 --> 01:58:45,100
So we can use it for infrared and radar and light.

1374
01:58:46,100 --> 01:58:49,100
Sound is a little trickier, because there's a time component in there,

1375
01:58:49,100 --> 01:58:54,100
and diffraction becomes a lot more important with those wavelengths.

1376
01:58:54,100 --> 01:58:56,100
We're adding support for that.

1377
01:58:56,100 --> 01:59:03,100
We want to move towards a system that's going to be able to do a lot of the same things

1378
01:59:03,100 --> 01:59:06,100
that we've been doing for a long time.

1379
01:59:07,100 --> 01:59:09,100
We're adding support for that.

1380
01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:20,100
We want to move towards a system for materials that's much more than just wave phenomenon.

1381
01:59:21,100 --> 01:59:24,100
If you look at what we've been doing in USD,

1382
01:59:24,100 --> 01:59:31,100
one of the first things we did was add a common description of rigid body properties,

1383
01:59:31,100 --> 01:59:33,100
physics properties, to it.

1384
01:59:33,100 --> 01:59:35,100
That's a type of material.

1385
01:59:36,100 --> 01:59:39,100
In rendering and computer graphics software, when we say material,

1386
01:59:39,100 --> 01:59:45,100
we just think about the component of a material that's about the visible light spectrum.

1387
01:59:45,100 --> 01:59:50,100
But what a material is, is actually all of the physics properties around that.

1388
01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:57,100
So we want to define all the different pieces of how you can describe a material,

1389
01:59:57,100 --> 01:59:59,100
then have a system where we can combine them all together.

1390
01:59:59,100 --> 02:00:04,100
So when you say this thing is a wood, it not only looks like it,

1391
02:00:04,100 --> 02:00:11,100
but it sounds like it and behaves like it when you crash things through it,

1392
02:00:11,100 --> 02:00:13,100
and so on and so forth.

1393
02:00:16,100 --> 02:00:17,100
Yes.

1394
02:00:29,100 --> 02:00:30,100
Mm-hmm.

1395
02:00:40,100 --> 02:00:41,100
Yeah.

1396
02:00:41,100 --> 02:00:42,100
Mm-hmm.

1397
02:00:57,100 --> 02:01:02,100
Well, first off, today, if you look at how a building is designed like that,

1398
02:01:02,100 --> 02:01:04,100
nothing is taken care of.

1399
02:01:04,100 --> 02:01:08,100
It's just kind of like all the different people working on it

1400
02:01:08,100 --> 02:01:11,100
kind of have their best practices that they've learned over decades,

1401
02:01:11,100 --> 02:01:14,100
and they just fly that and wish for the best.

1402
02:01:15,100 --> 02:01:18,100
A few years back, I don't know if you guys remember.

1403
02:01:18,100 --> 02:01:21,100
Maybe it was not just a few years, like 10 years ago, so you were babies.

1404
02:01:23,100 --> 02:01:24,100
There were a few buildings.

1405
02:01:24,100 --> 02:01:25,100
There was one in London.

1406
02:01:25,100 --> 02:01:27,100
They called it Death Ray.

1407
02:01:27,100 --> 02:01:33,100
It was like this very shiny mirror-like building, but with curves,

1408
02:01:33,100 --> 02:01:37,100
and it literally melted a car.

1409
02:01:37,100 --> 02:01:41,100
Like the sun came in at just the right angle this time of the year

1410
02:01:41,100 --> 02:01:45,100
and turned into a magnifying glass focusing all the light

1411
02:01:45,100 --> 02:01:47,100
and melted this one car down,

1412
02:01:47,100 --> 02:01:50,100
and that's something that none of them predicted.

1413
02:01:50,100 --> 02:01:52,100
They just said, this curves look pretty,

1414
02:01:52,100 --> 02:01:55,100
and it would be cool if it's mirror-like, and that's that.

1415
02:01:56,100 --> 02:01:59,100
When we built our headquarters building a few years ago,

1416
02:02:01,100 --> 02:02:05,100
we have this really cool design, and it's inspired by computer graphics.

1417
02:02:05,100 --> 02:02:10,100
It's all triangles, and one of the things Jensen wanted was natural light

1418
02:02:10,100 --> 02:02:12,100
so we could take advantage of the fact that we're in California,

1419
02:02:12,100 --> 02:02:14,100
and we have natural light all the time,

1420
02:02:14,100 --> 02:02:15,100
so we had these skylights in there.

1421
02:02:15,100 --> 02:02:18,100
There's these triangles that were glass up at the top,

1422
02:02:18,100 --> 02:02:20,100
and the sides of the building are all glass.

1423
02:02:21,100 --> 02:02:23,100
We decided to simulate it.

1424
02:02:23,100 --> 02:02:27,100
We used this architect that's a big, world-famous architect, Gensler,

1425
02:02:29,100 --> 02:02:31,100
and they know what they're doing,

1426
02:02:31,100 --> 02:02:35,100
but we took their design and ran it through our simulator

1427
02:02:35,100 --> 02:02:38,100
with that heat map that we did.

1428
02:02:38,100 --> 02:02:42,100
We did one of those, and we found that we were going to fry our humans.

1429
02:02:43,100 --> 02:02:48,100
The number of skylights we had was like two or three times too many,

1430
02:02:48,100 --> 02:02:49,100
and they were way too big.

1431
02:02:50,100 --> 02:02:53,100
Also, the glass on the sides,

1432
02:02:54,100 --> 02:02:59,100
we had to tilt further away and put soffits

1433
02:02:59,100 --> 02:03:01,100
so that we had shadow coming in.

1434
02:03:01,100 --> 02:03:04,100
Otherwise, the people that were on the edge of the building

1435
02:03:04,100 --> 02:03:08,100
were going to be fried in this greenhouse right there.

1436
02:03:08,100 --> 02:03:10,100
There's no way to know this.

1437
02:03:10,100 --> 02:03:14,100
We would have found out if we hadn't run that simulation.

1438
02:03:14,100 --> 02:03:16,100
We would have found out after they built it.

1439
02:03:17,100 --> 02:03:19,100
The type of stuff you're talking about,

1440
02:03:19,100 --> 02:03:23,100
they don't do any of that at simulation.

1441
02:03:23,100 --> 02:03:24,100
I know it's very surprising,

1442
02:03:25,100 --> 02:03:29,100
but in most cases,

1443
02:03:29,100 --> 02:03:34,100
they don't even have the appropriate data pulled in together

1444
02:03:34,100 --> 02:03:36,100
in a form where they can simulate it.

1445
02:03:37,100 --> 02:03:39,100
We're trying to solve that first.

1446
02:03:39,100 --> 02:03:42,100
That's the first and probably biggest problem.

1447
02:03:42,100 --> 02:03:45,100
It's just collecting all the data in one place

1448
02:03:45,100 --> 02:03:49,100
in a form where it's easy to then go run these various simulations.

1449
02:03:54,100 --> 02:03:55,100
Any other questions?

1450
02:03:56,100 --> 02:03:57,100
There's two over here.

1451
02:03:58,100 --> 02:04:00,100
You guys choose amongst yourselves.

1452
02:04:01,100 --> 02:04:02,100
Yeah.

1453
02:04:27,100 --> 02:04:29,100
Well, like I said earlier,

1454
02:04:30,100 --> 02:04:34,100
our positioning,

1455
02:04:34,100 --> 02:04:38,100
what we do fundamentally is build technology.

1456
02:04:39,100 --> 02:04:41,100
We make it in such a way that others can take it

1457
02:04:41,100 --> 02:04:42,100
and go build those applications.

1458
02:04:42,100 --> 02:04:45,100
It's unlikely we're going to build a social network

1459
02:04:45,100 --> 02:04:47,100
or even a video game.

1460
02:04:47,100 --> 02:04:49,100
We build all of the core tech

1461
02:04:49,100 --> 02:04:51,100
and solve a lot of the really hard problems

1462
02:04:51,100 --> 02:04:54,100
so they can go focus on the last mile problem,

1463
02:04:54,100 --> 02:04:56,100
which is really, really important.

1464
02:04:57,100 --> 02:05:02,100
The common thing people say about AI

1465
02:05:02,100 --> 02:05:03,100
is you need all this data,

1466
02:05:03,100 --> 02:05:05,100
and we assume when we say data these days

1467
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:07,100
that it's all the social data.

1468
02:05:07,100 --> 02:05:10,100
But actually, most of the data about the world

1469
02:05:10,100 --> 02:05:12,100
isn't social stuff.

1470
02:05:12,100 --> 02:05:15,100
There's lots of data in this room here

1471
02:05:15,100 --> 02:05:18,100
that has nothing to do with our social interactions.

1472
02:05:18,100 --> 02:05:19,100
We don't have to get into your private lives

1473
02:05:19,100 --> 02:05:21,100
to model these things.

1474
02:05:21,100 --> 02:05:23,100
In the case of, say, Deutsche Bahn,

1475
02:05:23,100 --> 02:05:28,100
I was talking about the train company for Germany.

1476
02:05:29,100 --> 02:05:32,100
They want to have typical behavior of crowds

1477
02:05:34,100 --> 02:05:35,100
on their platforms,

1478
02:05:35,100 --> 02:05:37,100
on different platforms, different times of the day,

1479
02:05:37,100 --> 02:05:39,100
so they can simulate the design of their platforms

1480
02:05:39,100 --> 02:05:41,100
and the trains, right?

1481
02:05:42,100 --> 02:05:45,100
We could gather tons and tons of data

1482
02:05:45,100 --> 02:05:48,100
from cameras that's completely anonymized,

1483
02:05:48,100 --> 02:05:51,100
get their poses and estimation just how they move,

1484
02:05:51,100 --> 02:05:53,100
move around and flow together,

1485
02:05:53,100 --> 02:05:56,100
that is not invasive at all.

1486
02:05:56,100 --> 02:05:59,100
And it's data that a social network doesn't have.

1487
02:05:59,100 --> 02:06:01,100
It's data that Deutsche Bahn has

1488
02:06:01,100 --> 02:06:03,100
because it's their platforms.

1489
02:06:03,100 --> 02:06:06,100
And so we can give them the technology

1490
02:06:06,100 --> 02:06:10,100
to go unlock that potential data stream for themselves

1491
02:06:10,100 --> 02:06:13,100
so they can model the thing they care about

1492
02:06:13,100 --> 02:06:15,100
and build a digital twin for that

1493
02:06:15,100 --> 02:06:18,100
and build behavior models for the humans in there

1494
02:06:18,100 --> 02:06:20,100
that are typical.

1495
02:06:21,100 --> 02:06:23,100
I think that data is more important

1496
02:06:23,100 --> 02:06:24,100
for most of the things I'm talking about

1497
02:06:24,100 --> 02:06:28,100
than arbitrary, you know, who likes what

1498
02:06:28,100 --> 02:06:34,100
and all the politics and crazy stuff

1499
02:06:34,100 --> 02:06:37,100
your uncle writes on Facebook and whatever, you know.

1500
02:06:41,100 --> 02:06:43,100
Yes, yes, you may.

1501
02:06:49,100 --> 02:06:52,100
I think Meta will be coming soon.

1502
02:06:53,100 --> 02:06:55,100
So, yeah.

1503
02:06:55,100 --> 02:06:57,100
So, before the question was that

1504
02:06:57,100 --> 02:07:01,100
if we have that kind of data, let's say,

1505
02:07:01,100 --> 02:07:03,100
how many of us have that?

1506
02:07:03,100 --> 02:07:05,100
Would that be usable for, like,

1507
02:07:05,100 --> 02:07:07,100
driving to studios, you know,

1508
02:07:07,100 --> 02:07:09,100
or is that just a cloud simulation

1509
02:07:09,100 --> 02:07:11,100
that you're talking about?

1510
02:07:11,100 --> 02:07:14,100
Yes, but I'm not sure you need

1511
02:07:14,100 --> 02:07:17,100
to capture that data as Meta to do it.

1512
02:07:17,100 --> 02:07:20,100
We're creating biomimetic humans,

1513
02:07:20,100 --> 02:07:23,100
you know, and simulating their muscles

1514
02:07:23,100 --> 02:07:28,100
and enough of the biophysics of the human

1515
02:07:28,100 --> 02:07:31,100
so we can generate the correct movement.

1516
02:07:31,100 --> 02:07:35,100
By the way, you can look up NVIDIA Holodeck.

1517
02:07:35,100 --> 02:07:38,100
It's a project we built on Unreal Engine

1518
02:07:38,100 --> 02:07:40,100
from years ago in VR.

1519
02:07:40,100 --> 02:07:43,100
We had legs back then.

1520
02:07:43,100 --> 02:07:44,100
You can look it up.

1521
02:07:44,100 --> 02:07:45,100
It's from, like, four years ago,

1522
02:07:45,100 --> 02:07:49,100
four or five years ago, and we had legs

1523
02:07:49,100 --> 02:07:51,100
because we generated it.

1524
02:07:51,100 --> 02:07:54,100
We created an AI model really quickly

1525
02:07:54,100 --> 02:07:56,100
to approximate where your legs should be

1526
02:07:56,100 --> 02:08:00,100
given the pose of your –

1527
02:08:00,100 --> 02:08:01,100
given the position of your hands

1528
02:08:01,100 --> 02:08:03,100
with the controllers and the HMD.

1529
02:08:03,100 --> 02:08:04,100
We could derive it.

1530
02:08:04,100 --> 02:08:06,100
We could even sit down and do all this stuff.

1531
02:08:06,100 --> 02:08:08,100
It's all in there.

1532
02:08:08,100 --> 02:08:10,100
It's not that hard.

1533
02:08:15,100 --> 02:08:18,100
All right. You had a question.

1534
02:08:28,100 --> 02:08:30,100
Thank you.

1535
02:08:45,100 --> 02:08:47,100
Mm-hmm.

1536
02:09:08,100 --> 02:09:12,100
Because of the energy usage of the computers?

1537
02:09:16,100 --> 02:09:20,100
What potential might there be?

1538
02:09:20,100 --> 02:09:22,100
Yeah, the big question,

1539
02:09:22,100 --> 02:09:26,100
the trillion-dollar question.

1540
02:09:26,100 --> 02:09:27,100
Right.

1541
02:09:27,100 --> 02:09:28,100
The trillion-dollar question is,

1542
02:09:28,100 --> 02:09:30,100
can we make an accurate enough simulator

1543
02:09:30,100 --> 02:09:33,100
that runs fast enough to predict the world

1544
02:09:33,100 --> 02:09:37,100
without using –

1545
02:09:37,100 --> 02:09:39,100
past a certain threshold of energy

1546
02:09:39,100 --> 02:09:41,100
that would actually accelerate the global –

1547
02:09:41,100 --> 02:09:43,100
and we believe we can.

1548
02:09:43,100 --> 02:09:45,100
We actually have early indicators

1549
02:09:45,100 --> 02:09:46,100
that this can work.

1550
02:09:46,100 --> 02:09:49,100
And the trick is AI.

1551
02:09:49,100 --> 02:09:54,100
So if we were going to build a simulator

1552
02:09:54,100 --> 02:09:56,100
based on traditional principle,

1553
02:09:56,100 --> 02:10:00,100
first principle physics, CFD and all that

1554
02:10:00,100 --> 02:10:03,100
that could scale, that could be fast enough

1555
02:10:03,100 --> 02:10:05,100
and be at meter scale,

1556
02:10:05,100 --> 02:10:07,100
we wouldn't have a computer,

1557
02:10:07,100 --> 02:10:08,100
supercomputer that could do that

1558
02:10:08,100 --> 02:10:12,100
for another 20 years probably.

1559
02:10:12,100 --> 02:10:16,100
But modern AI is essentially

1560
02:10:16,100 --> 02:10:20,100
just an awesome function approximator.

1561
02:10:20,100 --> 02:10:22,100
That's basically –

1562
02:10:22,100 --> 02:10:25,100
you can roughly think of AI as

1563
02:10:25,100 --> 02:10:27,100
you give it a whole bunch of example data

1564
02:10:27,100 --> 02:10:29,100
of what the inputs and outputs should be

1565
02:10:29,100 --> 02:10:31,100
and you end up with this neural network

1566
02:10:31,100 --> 02:10:33,100
that's an approximation of this function.

1567
02:10:33,100 --> 02:10:35,100
And in many cases,

1568
02:10:35,100 --> 02:10:36,100
we don't know what the function is

1569
02:10:36,100 --> 02:10:38,100
and that's why it's magical, right?

1570
02:10:38,100 --> 02:10:40,100
We're saying, I want this function

1571
02:10:40,100 --> 02:10:41,100
that tells me the difference

1572
02:10:41,100 --> 02:10:42,100
between a cat and a dog

1573
02:10:42,100 --> 02:10:44,100
and I just give it examples of it

1574
02:10:44,100 --> 02:10:45,100
and it figures out

1575
02:10:45,100 --> 02:10:48,100
what the function of that is.

1576
02:10:48,100 --> 02:10:50,100
We're essentially doing that

1577
02:10:50,100 --> 02:10:53,100
for all kinds of physics now,

1578
02:10:53,100 --> 02:10:56,100
including fluid dynamics,

1579
02:10:56,100 --> 02:10:58,100
which is a notoriously hard problem.

1580
02:10:58,100 --> 02:11:00,100
It's a chaotic system.

1581
02:11:00,100 --> 02:11:04,100
So the way it kind of works is

1582
02:11:04,100 --> 02:11:06,100
you have a principle simulator

1583
02:11:06,100 --> 02:11:07,100
that's wrong,

1584
02:11:07,100 --> 02:11:09,100
that doesn't actually predict the world,

1585
02:11:09,100 --> 02:11:10,100
but it roughly knows

1586
02:11:10,100 --> 02:11:14,100
what the basic rules of physics are.

1587
02:11:14,100 --> 02:11:15,100
And then we can run that

1588
02:11:15,100 --> 02:11:16,100
with the data that we're ingesting

1589
02:11:16,100 --> 02:11:17,100
from the world

1590
02:11:17,100 --> 02:11:19,100
with all of our sensors around the world.

1591
02:11:19,100 --> 02:11:20,100
We can compare the outputs

1592
02:11:20,100 --> 02:11:22,100
and see what's the delta.

1593
02:11:22,100 --> 02:11:25,100
How is it different?

1594
02:11:25,100 --> 02:11:28,100
And then we train an AI system

1595
02:11:28,100 --> 02:11:30,100
to learn that difference

1596
02:11:30,100 --> 02:11:32,100
to correct the function.

1597
02:11:32,100 --> 02:11:34,100
And if you do this with enough data

1598
02:11:34,100 --> 02:11:35,100
for long enough,

1599
02:11:35,100 --> 02:11:36,100
you don't even have to understand

1600
02:11:36,100 --> 02:11:37,100
all of the factors

1601
02:11:37,100 --> 02:11:39,100
of the real system in the world.

1602
02:11:39,100 --> 02:11:40,100
And you don't have to do

1603
02:11:40,100 --> 02:11:41,100
all of the computation

1604
02:11:41,100 --> 02:11:45,100
down to every water molecule

1605
02:11:45,100 --> 02:11:46,100
in the world.

1606
02:11:46,100 --> 02:11:48,100
You can kind of...

1607
02:11:48,100 --> 02:11:51,100
It figures out what that function is

1608
02:11:51,100 --> 02:11:52,100
and we can calculate it.

1609
02:11:52,100 --> 02:11:55,100
And so that gives us a bunch of benefits.

1610
02:11:55,100 --> 02:11:57,100
One is that AI and neural networks

1611
02:11:57,100 --> 02:11:59,100
are easily computationally scalable.

1612
02:11:59,100 --> 02:12:01,100
They're embarrassingly parallel.

1613
02:12:01,100 --> 02:12:02,100
So you can take this function

1614
02:12:02,100 --> 02:12:04,100
and scale it as wide as you want.

1615
02:12:04,100 --> 02:12:05,100
But it also turns out

1616
02:12:05,100 --> 02:12:07,100
it needs a far less computation

1617
02:12:07,100 --> 02:12:09,100
to do the same things.

1618
02:12:09,100 --> 02:12:10,100
Those approximators

1619
02:12:10,100 --> 02:12:12,100
can give you something

1620
02:12:12,100 --> 02:12:14,100
that's as accurate

1621
02:12:14,100 --> 02:12:17,100
because even our principled methods

1622
02:12:17,100 --> 02:12:18,100
are inaccurate.

1623
02:12:18,100 --> 02:12:20,100
They're missing a lot of terms

1624
02:12:20,100 --> 02:12:23,100
and variables

1625
02:12:23,100 --> 02:12:25,100
from the real world.

1626
02:12:25,100 --> 02:12:27,100
But we can feed real world data

1627
02:12:27,100 --> 02:12:28,100
along with our principled

1628
02:12:28,100 --> 02:12:30,100
physics simulator data

1629
02:12:30,100 --> 02:12:31,100
into this thing.

1630
02:12:31,100 --> 02:12:33,100
So by our calculations,

1631
02:12:33,100 --> 02:12:35,100
for far less energy

1632
02:12:35,100 --> 02:12:39,100
than we'll be saving,

1633
02:12:39,100 --> 02:12:42,100
we can go compute this.

1634
02:12:46,100 --> 02:12:47,100
Sure.

1635
02:13:03,100 --> 02:13:15,100
Well, we're still using some of those.

1636
02:13:15,100 --> 02:13:17,100
I mean, we use HTTPS transport

1637
02:13:17,100 --> 02:13:21,100
and some of the basics.

1638
02:13:21,100 --> 02:13:22,100
Yes, so there are.

1639
02:13:22,100 --> 02:13:24,100
So this is what...

1640
02:13:24,100 --> 02:13:27,100
The analogy breaks down a little bit

1641
02:13:27,100 --> 02:13:29,100
in that we want...

1642
02:13:29,100 --> 02:13:31,100
In the initial days of the web

1643
02:13:31,100 --> 02:13:33,100
and even today,

1644
02:13:33,100 --> 02:13:35,100
the 2D world that you have

1645
02:13:35,100 --> 02:13:38,100
is not really multiplayer by default.

1646
02:13:38,100 --> 02:13:40,100
You and I can't edit the web page

1647
02:13:40,100 --> 02:13:42,100
simultaneously.

1648
02:13:42,100 --> 02:13:43,100
We kind of have a little bit of this

1649
02:13:43,100 --> 02:13:45,100
with Google Docs.

1650
02:13:45,100 --> 02:13:48,100
We can go into a Word style doc

1651
02:13:48,100 --> 02:13:49,100
or a spreadsheet

1652
02:13:49,100 --> 02:13:51,100
and edit it at the same time

1653
02:13:51,100 --> 02:13:53,100
and change the state inside that.

1654
02:13:53,100 --> 02:13:56,100
But that's not an open protocol

1655
02:13:56,100 --> 02:13:58,100
of any sort.

1656
02:13:58,100 --> 02:14:02,100
What we wanted is essentially

1657
02:14:02,100 --> 02:14:04,100
that same capability,

1658
02:14:04,100 --> 02:14:05,100
the ability,

1659
02:14:05,100 --> 02:14:07,100
what you have in Google Sheets,

1660
02:14:07,100 --> 02:14:10,100
but for all USD data.

1661
02:14:10,100 --> 02:14:12,100
And so any application

1662
02:14:12,100 --> 02:14:15,100
that connects to the same database,

1663
02:14:15,100 --> 02:14:16,100
the same web server,

1664
02:14:16,100 --> 02:14:17,100
you can think of,

1665
02:14:17,100 --> 02:14:19,100
what we call Nucleus,

1666
02:14:19,100 --> 02:14:20,100
Omniverse Nucleus,

1667
02:14:20,100 --> 02:14:22,100
can live,

1668
02:14:22,100 --> 02:14:24,100
can subscribe to any changes

1669
02:14:24,100 --> 02:14:26,100
that happen to that data

1670
02:14:26,100 --> 02:14:28,100
and they can also publish changes.

1671
02:14:28,100 --> 02:14:31,100
And so we've created a protocol

1672
02:14:31,100 --> 02:14:34,100
and a stack that can efficiently calculate

1673
02:14:34,100 --> 02:14:37,100
when any one client changes something.

1674
02:14:37,100 --> 02:14:39,100
So if you change the color of a material

1675
02:14:39,100 --> 02:14:41,100
or move a few vertices

1676
02:14:41,100 --> 02:14:43,100
or change a transform

1677
02:14:43,100 --> 02:14:44,100
somewhere in the scene graph,

1678
02:14:44,100 --> 02:14:45,100
your side,

1679
02:14:45,100 --> 02:14:48,100
very quickly calculates what that changes,

1680
02:14:48,100 --> 02:14:50,100
transmits only that delta.

1681
02:14:50,100 --> 02:14:52,100
The Nucleus server applies that change

1682
02:14:52,100 --> 02:14:54,100
to the database

1683
02:14:54,100 --> 02:14:55,100
and for any other clients

1684
02:14:55,100 --> 02:14:56,100
that are subscribing,

1685
02:14:56,100 --> 02:14:59,100
transmits that change to them.

1686
02:14:59,100 --> 02:15:00,100
It's essentially the same thing

1687
02:15:00,100 --> 02:15:01,100
as what a game,

1688
02:15:01,100 --> 02:15:03,100
multiplayer game server is doing,

1689
02:15:03,100 --> 02:15:04,100
an MMO,

1690
02:15:04,100 --> 02:15:06,100
but those servers are constrained

1691
02:15:06,100 --> 02:15:09,100
to the small amount of specific states

1692
02:15:09,100 --> 02:15:11,100
that's relevant to the game,

1693
02:15:11,100 --> 02:15:12,100
the positions of people,

1694
02:15:12,100 --> 02:15:14,100
whether they shot their gun

1695
02:15:14,100 --> 02:15:16,100
or in Minecraft,

1696
02:15:16,100 --> 02:15:17,100
where they build a blocks

1697
02:15:17,100 --> 02:15:20,100
or a few specific things.

1698
02:15:20,100 --> 02:15:21,100
We've generalized it

1699
02:15:21,100 --> 02:15:23,100
so that any property in USD anywhere

1700
02:15:23,100 --> 02:15:24,100
that's changed

1701
02:15:24,100 --> 02:15:26,100
will be synchronized across all of them.

1702
02:15:26,100 --> 02:15:30,100
And so you get that Minecraft thing

1703
02:15:30,100 --> 02:15:32,100
that we're talking about.

1704
02:15:32,100 --> 02:15:34,100
Eventually we'll figure out

1705
02:15:34,100 --> 02:15:35,100
which parts of this

1706
02:15:35,100 --> 02:15:37,100
we should open up and make a standard.

1707
02:15:37,100 --> 02:15:38,100
We've done three or four iterations

1708
02:15:38,100 --> 02:15:40,100
on the algorithms

1709
02:15:40,100 --> 02:15:42,100
to generate those deltas

1710
02:15:42,100 --> 02:15:43,100
and transmit them.

1711
02:15:43,100 --> 02:15:45,100
So it wasn't ready to propose

1712
02:15:45,100 --> 02:15:47,100
as any kind of standard quite yet

1713
02:15:47,100 --> 02:15:49,100
because it just hadn't been done before

1714
02:15:49,100 --> 02:15:51,100
or somebody had to invent it.

1715
02:15:51,100 --> 02:15:52,100
And so it took us a few years

1716
02:15:52,100 --> 02:15:54,100
to land on the right one.

1717
02:15:54,100 --> 02:15:56,100
And we think we have a good solution now.

1718
02:15:56,100 --> 02:16:02,100
So we'll likely open up parts of that.

1719
02:16:02,100 --> 02:16:05,100
All right.

1720
02:16:05,100 --> 02:16:08,100
There's one more up there.

1721
02:16:09,100 --> 02:16:26,100
Yeah.

1722
02:16:26,100 --> 02:16:28,100
We live in the world of electrons mostly,

1723
02:16:28,100 --> 02:16:30,100
not in the world of atoms.

1724
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:32,100
We're more than happy to connect

1725
02:16:32,100 --> 02:16:33,100
to any haptic device

1726
02:16:33,100 --> 02:16:35,100
and provide it the signals it needs

1727
02:16:35,100 --> 02:16:37,100
to do what it's going to do.

1728
02:16:37,100 --> 02:16:39,100
But we're not building haptic devices.

1729
02:16:39,100 --> 02:16:43,100
As new display technologies,

1730
02:16:43,100 --> 02:16:45,100
as haptic devices,

1731
02:16:45,100 --> 02:16:47,100
input devices are created,

1732
02:16:47,100 --> 02:16:48,100
we'll be the first ones

1733
02:16:48,100 --> 02:16:50,100
to take advantage of it

1734
02:16:50,100 --> 02:16:53,100
and simulate whatever we can

1735
02:16:53,100 --> 02:16:54,100
with the data that we receive

1736
02:16:54,100 --> 02:16:55,100
from the world

1737
02:16:55,100 --> 02:16:57,100
and then send signals back

1738
02:16:57,100 --> 02:16:59,100
to operate on the world from it.

1739
02:16:59,100 --> 02:17:01,100
You can think about the robots

1740
02:17:01,100 --> 02:17:03,100
that we're operating as haptic devices.

1741
02:17:04,100 --> 02:17:06,100
Right?

1742
02:17:06,100 --> 02:17:07,100
You can send a signal back.

1743
02:17:07,100 --> 02:17:10,100
You can imagine teleporting

1744
02:17:10,100 --> 02:17:12,100
to that factory I was talking about

1745
02:17:12,100 --> 02:17:14,100
in your VR headset

1746
02:17:14,100 --> 02:17:15,100
and moving an object

1747
02:17:15,100 --> 02:17:17,100
inside the virtual world

1748
02:17:17,100 --> 02:17:19,100
and then some robot

1749
02:17:19,100 --> 02:17:21,100
inside the real world

1750
02:17:21,100 --> 02:17:22,100
actually goes and moves it

1751
02:17:22,100 --> 02:17:23,100
to that position

1752
02:17:23,100 --> 02:17:26,100
to synchronize my edit to the world

1753
02:17:26,100 --> 02:17:28,100
with the real world one.

1754
02:17:28,100 --> 02:17:30,100
That's sort of haptic feedback.

1755
02:17:30,100 --> 02:17:33,100
We are indirectly working on that,

1756
02:17:33,100 --> 02:17:34,100
but we're going to wait

1757
02:17:34,100 --> 02:17:36,100
for the kinds of haptic devices

1758
02:17:36,100 --> 02:17:37,100
you're talking about.

1759
02:17:37,100 --> 02:17:39,100
They're still in their infancy.

1760
02:18:01,100 --> 02:18:02,100
Where you are essentially

1761
02:18:02,100 --> 02:18:04,100
crowdsourcing building

1762
02:18:04,100 --> 02:18:06,100
the entire digital world

1763
02:18:06,100 --> 02:18:07,100
using nodes.

1764
02:18:07,100 --> 02:18:09,100
I mean, that's an opinion kind of thing,

1765
02:18:09,100 --> 02:18:11,100
but I think, yeah, absolutely.

1766
02:18:11,100 --> 02:18:12,100
I think the world will build it

1767
02:18:12,100 --> 02:18:13,100
if you have open standards

1768
02:18:13,100 --> 02:18:15,100
to describe the world.

1769
02:18:15,100 --> 02:18:19,100
You guys are working on that stuff, right?

1770
02:18:19,100 --> 02:18:20,100
Then I think the world

1771
02:18:20,100 --> 02:18:22,100
will take advantage of it

1772
02:18:22,100 --> 02:18:24,100
and go crowdsource those things.

1773
02:18:24,100 --> 02:18:27,100
Why not?

1774
02:18:27,100 --> 02:18:28,100
I don't think it needs to belong

1775
02:18:28,100 --> 02:18:29,100
to any one company.

1776
02:18:29,100 --> 02:18:30,100
It doesn't.

1777
02:18:30,100 --> 02:18:31,100
All that information

1778
02:18:31,100 --> 02:18:32,100
that's in the public

1779
02:18:32,100 --> 02:18:37,100
belongs to the public.

1780
02:18:37,100 --> 02:18:38,100
The other question that I have

1781
02:18:38,100 --> 02:18:40,100
is more general around

1782
02:18:40,100 --> 02:18:42,100
any of the devices.

1783
02:18:42,100 --> 02:18:46,100
Sure.

1784
02:18:46,100 --> 02:18:56,100
All right.

1785
02:18:56,100 --> 02:19:25,100
So,

1786
02:19:25,100 --> 02:19:27,100
all the stuff I discussed

1787
02:19:27,100 --> 02:19:29,100
still needs to be built.

1788
02:19:29,100 --> 02:19:31,100
There's very little...

1789
02:19:31,100 --> 02:19:33,100
And it's funny.

1790
02:19:33,100 --> 02:19:35,100
People immediately start thinking

1791
02:19:35,100 --> 02:19:37,100
about things in terms of competition,

1792
02:19:37,100 --> 02:19:38,100
usually.

1793
02:19:38,100 --> 02:19:40,100
Like, we're competing with Meta

1794
02:19:40,100 --> 02:19:41,100
because they have a Metaverse

1795
02:19:41,100 --> 02:19:43,100
and Microsoft and Google

1796
02:19:43,100 --> 02:19:45,100
and whatever.

1797
02:19:45,100 --> 02:19:46,100
There's just so much

1798
02:19:46,100 --> 02:19:47,100
that needs to be done.

1799
02:19:47,100 --> 02:19:49,100
There's no reason to compete.

1800
02:19:49,100 --> 02:19:50,100
I think we can kind of

1801
02:19:50,100 --> 02:19:52,100
divide up the problem

1802
02:19:52,100 --> 02:19:54,100
and if we are going to be

1803
02:19:54,100 --> 02:19:56,100
maximally efficient here,

1804
02:19:56,100 --> 02:19:57,100
we should divide up that pie

1805
02:19:57,100 --> 02:19:58,100
and have everybody

1806
02:19:58,100 --> 02:19:59,100
go work on different pieces of it

1807
02:19:59,100 --> 02:20:00,100
and make them interop together

1808
02:20:00,100 --> 02:20:03,100
and work together nicely.

1809
02:20:03,100 --> 02:20:04,100
Otherwise, we're wasting

1810
02:20:04,100 --> 02:20:05,100
a lot of energy.

1811
02:20:05,100 --> 02:20:06,100
Some amount of competition

1812
02:20:06,100 --> 02:20:08,100
is good just to...

1813
02:20:08,100 --> 02:20:10,100
There should be a competition of ideas,

1814
02:20:10,100 --> 02:20:13,100
better ways to do things.

1815
02:20:13,100 --> 02:20:16,100
I don't think I or anyone

1816
02:20:16,100 --> 02:20:18,100
can predict what the most important

1817
02:20:18,100 --> 02:20:19,100
new startup companies

1818
02:20:19,100 --> 02:20:20,100
are going to be.

1819
02:20:20,100 --> 02:20:22,100
That's kind of the nature

1820
02:20:23,100 --> 02:20:26,100
of transformational computing platforms.

1821
02:20:26,100 --> 02:20:27,100
Computers themselves,

1822
02:20:27,100 --> 02:20:28,100
like I said,

1823
02:20:28,100 --> 02:20:30,100
they do nothing.

1824
02:20:30,100 --> 02:20:33,100
They're just a general purpose machine

1825
02:20:33,100 --> 02:20:37,100
that runs arbitrary programs.

1826
02:20:37,100 --> 02:20:39,100
It's going to take people

1827
02:20:39,100 --> 02:20:42,100
who are experts in their domains,

1828
02:20:42,100 --> 02:20:43,100
different areas,

1829
02:20:43,100 --> 02:20:45,100
to go apply that core technology

1830
02:20:45,100 --> 02:20:48,100
to real problems.

1831
02:20:48,100 --> 02:20:49,100
And so, what I would love to see

1832
02:20:49,100 --> 02:20:50,100
for Omniverse

1833
02:20:50,100 --> 02:20:52,100
and what I'm trying really hard

1834
02:20:52,100 --> 02:20:56,100
to push with our developer relations

1835
02:20:56,100 --> 02:20:59,100
and our business development people

1836
02:20:59,100 --> 02:21:03,100
is helping small companies

1837
02:21:03,100 --> 02:21:07,100
in various industries

1838
02:21:07,100 --> 02:21:10,100
get Omniverse expertise

1839
02:21:10,100 --> 02:21:12,100
so they can leverage our technology

1840
02:21:12,100 --> 02:21:13,100
to build solutions

1841
02:21:13,100 --> 02:21:15,100
for their particular place.

1842
02:21:15,100 --> 02:21:16,100
Because we can't go build

1843
02:21:16,100 --> 02:21:18,100
all of the applications

1844
02:21:18,100 --> 02:21:19,100
for every industry,

1845
02:21:19,100 --> 02:21:22,100
every tool, every simulator.

1846
02:21:22,100 --> 02:21:24,100
The world has to do that.

1847
02:21:24,100 --> 02:21:26,100
So, I'm not sure exactly

1848
02:21:26,100 --> 02:21:27,100
which ones they are,

1849
02:21:27,100 --> 02:21:29,100
but for Omniverse,

1850
02:21:29,100 --> 02:21:30,100
anyone that's at the intersection

1851
02:21:30,100 --> 02:21:34,100
of the industrial real world

1852
02:21:34,100 --> 02:21:39,100
and computation virtual worlds,

1853
02:21:39,100 --> 02:21:40,100
I think there's a lot

1854
02:21:40,100 --> 02:21:42,100
of opportunities here.

1855
02:21:42,100 --> 02:21:44,100
Every company who does anything

1856
02:21:44,100 --> 02:21:46,100
in the real world

1857
02:21:46,100 --> 02:21:47,100
is going to need to model

1858
02:21:47,100 --> 02:21:52,100
a digital version of it.

1859
02:21:52,100 --> 02:21:53,100
I'm not sure that's

1860
02:21:53,100 --> 02:21:55,100
a satisfying answer.

1861
02:21:55,100 --> 02:21:56,100
If you're looking for me

1862
02:21:56,100 --> 02:21:58,100
to give you a business plan for...

1863
02:21:58,100 --> 02:22:00,100
You know, we can talk about that later.

1864
02:22:00,100 --> 02:22:10,100
For everything.

1865
02:22:25,100 --> 02:22:28,100
No, I think that

1866
02:22:28,100 --> 02:22:29,100
you're always going to have

1867
02:22:29,100 --> 02:22:32,100
a component of the traditional

1868
02:22:32,100 --> 02:22:33,100
principled methods

1869
02:22:33,100 --> 02:22:37,100
combined with the AI methods.

1870
02:22:37,100 --> 02:22:41,100
You can use machine learning

1871
02:22:41,100 --> 02:22:44,100
to learn transcendental functions.

1872
02:22:44,100 --> 02:22:45,100
You can learn sine and cosine

1873
02:22:45,100 --> 02:22:46,100
and whatever.

1874
02:22:46,100 --> 02:22:48,100
Why bother?

1875
02:22:48,100 --> 02:22:49,100
You can just put the sine

1876
02:22:49,100 --> 02:22:50,100
and cosine function

1877
02:22:50,100 --> 02:22:52,100
right in your neural network

1878
02:22:52,100 --> 02:22:54,100
as a layer in there.

1879
02:22:54,100 --> 02:22:55,100
It doesn't make sense.

1880
02:22:55,100 --> 02:22:56,100
If you know the underlying

1881
02:22:57,100 --> 02:23:00,100
physics equations for something,

1882
02:23:00,100 --> 02:23:01,100
then you don't need to have it

1883
02:23:01,100 --> 02:23:02,100
learn all of it.

1884
02:23:02,100 --> 02:23:05,100
You can shape your neural net

1885
02:23:05,100 --> 02:23:07,100
to fit the problem

1886
02:23:07,100 --> 02:23:09,100
and make it more efficient

1887
02:23:09,100 --> 02:23:10,100
and have it learn something

1888
02:23:10,100 --> 02:23:14,100
much bigger than it otherwise would.

1889
02:23:19,100 --> 02:23:20,100
Okay.

1890
02:23:21,100 --> 02:23:23,100
We have a lot of students

1891
02:23:23,100 --> 02:23:25,100
who are probably graduating

1892
02:23:25,100 --> 02:23:26,100
who maybe have one

1893
02:23:26,100 --> 02:23:28,100
or two semesters left.

1894
02:23:28,100 --> 02:23:30,100
What are some key ideas,

1895
02:23:30,100 --> 02:23:32,100
omnivorous or otherwise,

1896
02:23:32,100 --> 02:23:33,100
that you can recommend

1897
02:23:33,100 --> 02:23:34,100
students work on

1898
02:23:34,100 --> 02:23:36,100
in a three to six month period

1899
02:23:36,100 --> 02:23:38,100
where they're taking an independent

1900
02:23:38,100 --> 02:23:40,100
study or otherwise

1901
02:23:40,100 --> 02:23:42,100
and be focusing on the problem?

1902
02:23:42,100 --> 02:23:45,100
So I hire a lot of

1903
02:23:45,100 --> 02:23:46,100
new college graduates

1904
02:23:46,100 --> 02:23:48,100
into my team.

1905
02:23:48,100 --> 02:23:52,100
A lot of PhDs

1906
02:23:52,100 --> 02:23:54,100
and masters

1907
02:23:54,100 --> 02:23:56,100
and bachelors.

1908
02:23:56,100 --> 02:23:57,100
All of them.

1909
02:23:57,100 --> 02:23:59,100
We hire them all.

1910
02:23:59,100 --> 02:24:01,100
The thing I care about the most,

1911
02:24:01,100 --> 02:24:02,100
actually,

1912
02:24:02,100 --> 02:24:04,100
I rarely care about the school

1913
02:24:04,100 --> 02:24:06,100
or the grades

1914
02:24:06,100 --> 02:24:08,100
or any of that.

1915
02:24:08,100 --> 02:24:12,100
First, I want to see passion

1916
02:24:12,100 --> 02:24:15,100
when I talk to a candidate.

1917
02:24:15,100 --> 02:24:18,100
If they seem excited about it,

1918
02:24:18,100 --> 02:24:20,100
like I am,

1919
02:24:20,100 --> 02:24:22,100
then I think there's a higher likelihood

1920
02:24:22,100 --> 02:24:25,100
they're going to work out in my team.

1921
02:24:27,100 --> 02:24:30,100
And one way that I get a signal

1922
02:24:30,100 --> 02:24:32,100
as to the passion

1923
02:24:32,100 --> 02:24:34,100
is to see projects

1924
02:24:34,100 --> 02:24:38,100
that they do on their own time

1925
02:24:38,100 --> 02:24:39,100
for their own love,

1926
02:24:39,100 --> 02:24:41,100
for their own passion.

1927
02:24:41,100 --> 02:24:43,100
It doesn't have to be perfect,

1928
02:24:43,100 --> 02:24:44,100
whatever the thing is,

1929
02:24:44,100 --> 02:24:45,100
the solution.

1930
02:24:45,100 --> 02:24:47,100
But the fact that

1931
02:24:47,100 --> 02:24:48,100
they went out and learned something

1932
02:24:48,100 --> 02:24:49,100
on their own

1933
02:24:49,100 --> 02:24:52,100
outside of what they learn

1934
02:24:52,100 --> 02:24:54,100
inside the classroom

1935
02:24:54,100 --> 02:24:56,100
and tried to solve a problem

1936
02:24:56,100 --> 02:24:57,100
on their own,

1937
02:24:57,100 --> 02:24:59,100
that means a lot.

1938
02:24:59,100 --> 02:25:02,100
And generally speaking,

1939
02:25:02,100 --> 02:25:03,100
the things you're going to do

1940
02:25:03,100 --> 02:25:04,100
out in the real world,

1941
02:25:04,100 --> 02:25:07,100
especially at a place like NVIDIA,

1942
02:25:07,100 --> 02:25:09,100
are going to require things

1943
02:25:09,100 --> 02:25:10,100
you didn't learn in school.

1944
02:25:10,100 --> 02:25:11,100
You didn't learn anywhere

1945
02:25:11,100 --> 02:25:13,100
because we're just figuring it out.

1946
02:25:13,100 --> 02:25:14,100
They're all new things.

1947
02:25:14,100 --> 02:25:17,100
We're on the cutting edge

1948
02:25:17,100 --> 02:25:21,100
of engineering and science and art.

1949
02:25:21,100 --> 02:25:24,100
And so the meta skill

1950
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:25,100
of being able to learn

1951
02:25:25,100 --> 02:25:27,100
and teach yourself

1952
02:25:27,100 --> 02:25:28,100
and take advantage

1953
02:25:28,100 --> 02:25:30,100
of the information around you

1954
02:25:30,100 --> 02:25:32,100
and harness that into something

1955
02:25:32,100 --> 02:25:35,100
is the most important thing I look for.

1956
02:25:36,100 --> 02:25:37,100
And I might have a bias

1957
02:25:37,100 --> 02:25:38,100
because that's just kind of

1958
02:25:38,100 --> 02:25:40,100
how I've always been myself.

1959
02:25:40,100 --> 02:25:42,100
I taught myself most of this stuff

1960
02:25:42,100 --> 02:25:46,100
by reading and Eric Haynes,

1961
02:25:46,100 --> 02:25:47,100
who I finally got to work with

1962
02:25:47,100 --> 02:25:50,100
after all those years

1963
02:25:50,100 --> 02:25:51,100
in ray tracing news.

1964
02:25:51,100 --> 02:25:54,100
But yeah, so

1965
02:25:54,100 --> 02:25:56,100
show me a cool project

1966
02:25:56,100 --> 02:25:57,100
that you did on your own

1967
02:25:57,100 --> 02:25:59,100
because you loved it.

1968
02:26:11,100 --> 02:26:13,100
Actually, if I could ask,

1969
02:26:13,100 --> 02:26:14,100
well, first of all,

1970
02:26:14,100 --> 02:26:15,100
thank you and your family

1971
02:26:15,100 --> 02:26:16,100
for coming all the way

1972
02:26:16,100 --> 02:26:17,100
across the country.

1973
02:26:17,100 --> 02:26:19,100
Thank you for hosting us.

1974
02:26:19,100 --> 02:26:20,100
All of us.

1975
02:26:20,100 --> 02:26:22,100
I love that you started your talk

1976
02:26:22,100 --> 02:26:25,100
with a long and deep history

1977
02:26:25,100 --> 02:26:26,100
of your journey

1978
02:26:26,100 --> 02:26:27,100
with computer graphics.

1979
02:26:27,100 --> 02:26:28,100
I think it's great for us to hear.

1980
02:26:28,100 --> 02:26:30,100
We want to know that the people

1981
02:26:30,100 --> 02:26:32,100
that are building the future.

1982
02:26:32,100 --> 02:26:33,100
And you had an interesting statement

1983
02:26:33,100 --> 02:26:34,100
where you said

1984
02:26:34,100 --> 02:26:36,100
you wiggled your way

1985
02:26:36,100 --> 02:26:38,100
into Waterfront.

1986
02:26:38,100 --> 02:26:39,100
And I got the sense

1987
02:26:39,100 --> 02:26:40,100
that maybe there was

1988
02:26:40,100 --> 02:26:41,100
an interesting story

1989
02:26:41,100 --> 02:26:42,100
you want to share.

1990
02:26:42,100 --> 02:26:43,100
Sure.

1991
02:26:43,100 --> 02:26:44,100
Or I just, you know,

1992
02:26:44,100 --> 02:26:45,100
I also get the sense

1993
02:26:45,100 --> 02:26:47,100
that there's a level of pride

1994
02:26:47,100 --> 02:26:50,100
that you had, right?

1995
02:26:50,100 --> 02:26:51,100
Maybe there's some soft skills

1996
02:26:51,100 --> 02:26:53,100
that you could also share

1997
02:26:53,100 --> 02:26:55,100
with recommendations.

1998
02:26:55,100 --> 02:26:56,100
Yeah, I can share that story

1999
02:26:56,100 --> 02:26:58,100
because it's interesting.

2000
02:26:58,100 --> 02:26:59,100
I'm not sure,

2001
02:26:59,100 --> 02:27:02,100
this is what I

2002
02:27:02,100 --> 02:27:04,100
talked to Rachel about,

2003
02:27:04,100 --> 02:27:05,100
whether it's useful for you.

2004
02:27:05,100 --> 02:27:08,100
Because my particular journey

2005
02:27:08,100 --> 02:27:11,100
is so weird

2006
02:27:11,100 --> 02:27:13,100
and not the norm

2007
02:27:13,100 --> 02:27:15,100
that I wouldn't recommend

2008
02:27:15,100 --> 02:27:16,100
most people do it

2009
02:27:16,100 --> 02:27:18,100
because it's probably a long shot

2010
02:27:18,100 --> 02:27:20,100
and wouldn't work.

2011
02:27:20,100 --> 02:27:22,100
But when I ended up

2012
02:27:22,100 --> 02:27:24,100
at Warner Brothers,

2013
02:27:24,100 --> 02:27:28,100
actually this part of it,

2014
02:27:28,100 --> 02:27:30,100
I think is relevant.

2015
02:27:30,100 --> 02:27:31,100
Before that,

2016
02:27:31,100 --> 02:27:34,100
I was interning at NASA JPL,

2017
02:27:34,100 --> 02:27:36,100
Jet Propulsion Lab,

2018
02:27:36,100 --> 02:27:38,100
as an academic part-time.

2019
02:27:38,100 --> 02:27:41,100
And my job was installing

2020
02:27:41,100 --> 02:27:44,100
web servers and web browsers

2021
02:27:44,100 --> 02:27:47,100
because it was 1993, 1994.

2022
02:27:47,100 --> 02:27:48,100
And I knew something

2023
02:27:48,100 --> 02:27:49,100
about the internet,

2024
02:27:49,100 --> 02:27:50,100
so they hired me as an intern

2025
02:27:50,100 --> 02:27:52,100
to go do that stuff.

2026
02:27:52,100 --> 02:27:55,100
And I remember watching

2027
02:27:55,100 --> 02:27:58,100
the web start to form.

2028
02:27:58,100 --> 02:28:00,100
This page showed up, Yahoo,

2029
02:28:00,100 --> 02:28:02,100
which consisted of like 10 links

2030
02:28:02,100 --> 02:28:04,100
to some interesting things.

2031
02:28:04,100 --> 02:28:08,100
And eventually,

2032
02:28:08,100 --> 02:28:10,100
it turned into like 100 links.

2033
02:28:10,100 --> 02:28:11,100
And eventually, they put

2034
02:28:11,100 --> 02:28:13,100
a little search bar up there.

2035
02:28:13,100 --> 02:28:15,100
It was a matter of months.

2036
02:28:15,100 --> 02:28:17,100
And then they went like IPO

2037
02:28:17,100 --> 02:28:19,100
and were worth hundreds

2038
02:28:19,100 --> 02:28:20,100
of millions of dollars

2039
02:28:20,100 --> 02:28:21,100
and billions of dollars.

2040
02:28:21,100 --> 02:28:22,100
It was crazy.

2041
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:24,100
So in this era,

2042
02:28:24,100 --> 02:28:27,100
the dot-com boom and bubble and bust,

2043
02:28:27,100 --> 02:28:28,100
there's tons and tons

2044
02:28:28,100 --> 02:28:29,100
of companies being formed.

2045
02:28:29,100 --> 02:28:31,100
And most of them just really

2046
02:28:31,100 --> 02:28:32,100
look like crappy companies

2047
02:28:32,100 --> 02:28:34,100
that were just looking

2048
02:28:34,100 --> 02:28:37,100
for a way to cash out quickly

2049
02:28:37,100 --> 02:28:39,100
and whatever.

2050
02:28:39,100 --> 02:28:40,100
And I knew something

2051
02:28:40,100 --> 02:28:41,100
about the internet

2052
02:28:41,100 --> 02:28:43,100
because I'd been on it earlier.

2053
02:28:43,100 --> 02:28:47,100
And so 1993, the web happened.

2054
02:28:47,100 --> 02:28:50,100
And Jurassic Park,

2055
02:28:50,100 --> 02:28:52,100
there was a fork in the road for me.

2056
02:28:52,100 --> 02:28:55,100
Am I going to do computer graphics

2057
02:28:55,100 --> 02:28:56,100
or go do internet stuff?

2058
02:28:56,100 --> 02:28:58,100
I like the internet.

2059
02:28:58,100 --> 02:29:01,100
I like computing in general.

2060
02:29:01,100 --> 02:29:04,100
But I love computer graphics.

2061
02:29:04,100 --> 02:29:06,100
And I made a conscious decision.

2062
02:29:06,100 --> 02:29:07,100
I'm like probably

2063
02:29:07,100 --> 02:29:08,100
a much higher likelihood

2064
02:29:08,100 --> 02:29:09,100
I'll be a millionaire

2065
02:29:09,100 --> 02:29:11,100
in the next few years

2066
02:29:11,100 --> 02:29:12,100
if I go down this road

2067
02:29:12,100 --> 02:29:13,100
with the internet.

2068
02:29:13,100 --> 02:29:14,100
But if I go down

2069
02:29:14,100 --> 02:29:16,100
the visual effects road,

2070
02:29:16,100 --> 02:29:18,100
I'll make good money.

2071
02:29:18,100 --> 02:29:19,100
Actually, I made really good money

2072
02:29:19,100 --> 02:29:21,100
for an 18-year-old.

2073
02:29:21,100 --> 02:29:23,100
We were doing the engineering tour

2074
02:29:23,100 --> 02:29:25,100
here earlier with them.

2075
02:29:25,100 --> 02:29:28,100
And the kid that was showing us

2076
02:29:28,100 --> 02:29:31,100
was from the arts side.

2077
02:29:31,100 --> 02:29:33,100
But he looked at

2078
02:29:33,100 --> 02:29:35,100
what the average salary was

2079
02:29:35,100 --> 02:29:36,100
for engineering students

2080
02:29:36,100 --> 02:29:37,100
who were hired,

2081
02:29:37,100 --> 02:29:38,100
which was six figures,

2082
02:29:38,100 --> 02:29:39,100
like $100,000.

2083
02:29:39,100 --> 02:29:41,100
And he was shocked.

2084
02:29:41,100 --> 02:29:42,100
Well, I was making that

2085
02:29:42,100 --> 02:29:45,100
at Disney and Warner Brothers

2086
02:29:45,100 --> 02:29:46,100
in 1996,

2087
02:29:46,100 --> 02:29:48,100
which was pretty impressive.

2088
02:29:48,100 --> 02:29:49,100
But I knew I could make

2089
02:29:49,100 --> 02:29:50,100
a lot more if I did

2090
02:29:50,100 --> 02:29:51,100
the internet thing.

2091
02:29:51,100 --> 02:29:53,100
But I thought to myself,

2092
02:29:53,100 --> 02:29:55,100
you know, that's enough money.

2093
02:29:55,100 --> 02:29:57,100
I just want to do

2094
02:29:57,100 --> 02:30:00,100
what I love every single day.

2095
02:30:00,100 --> 02:30:02,100
And I watched as many people

2096
02:30:02,100 --> 02:30:04,100
around me became millionaires.

2097
02:30:04,100 --> 02:30:05,100
I kept wondering, like,

2098
02:30:05,100 --> 02:30:06,100
did I make the right decision

2099
02:30:06,100 --> 02:30:08,100
all those years?

2100
02:30:08,100 --> 02:30:10,100
But I always came back to

2101
02:30:10,100 --> 02:30:12,100
I'm doing fine.

2102
02:30:12,100 --> 02:30:14,100
And I wake up every morning

2103
02:30:14,100 --> 02:30:16,100
excited to work on

2104
02:30:16,100 --> 02:30:18,100
what I'm working on.

2105
02:30:18,100 --> 02:30:20,100
And it doesn't feel like work to me

2106
02:30:20,100 --> 02:30:21,100
because I've been doing this

2107
02:30:21,100 --> 02:30:23,100
since I was 10 years old,

2108
02:30:23,100 --> 02:30:24,100
10, 11 years old.

2109
02:30:24,100 --> 02:30:26,100
This is what I would be doing anyway

2110
02:30:26,100 --> 02:30:28,100
just because I love it so much.

2111
02:30:28,100 --> 02:30:29,100
And I'll be doing it probably

2112
02:30:29,100 --> 02:30:30,100
until the day I die

2113
02:30:30,100 --> 02:30:32,100
or until I'm too senile

2114
02:30:32,100 --> 02:30:34,100
to be able to do it.

2115
02:30:34,100 --> 02:30:37,100
So I think that's really important.

2116
02:30:37,100 --> 02:30:38,100
First and foremost,

2117
02:30:38,100 --> 02:30:41,100
just do the thing that you love.

2118
02:30:41,100 --> 02:30:43,100
I'm not saying, like, you know,

2119
02:30:43,100 --> 02:30:46,100
maybe what you love is origami.

2120
02:30:46,100 --> 02:30:48,100
I'm not saying go make a business

2121
02:30:48,100 --> 02:30:49,100
out of that.

2122
02:30:49,100 --> 02:30:51,100
Do something reasonable

2123
02:30:51,100 --> 02:30:53,100
that might actually have a career

2124
02:30:53,100 --> 02:30:54,100
behind it that you love,

2125
02:30:54,100 --> 02:30:56,100
happen to love as well.

2126
02:30:56,100 --> 02:30:58,100
That's always more important,

2127
02:30:58,100 --> 02:30:59,100
I think,

2128
02:30:59,100 --> 02:31:02,100
than doing the thing that just

2129
02:31:02,100 --> 02:31:05,100
is probably the better path for money

2130
02:31:05,100 --> 02:31:07,100
because, in reality,

2131
02:31:07,100 --> 02:31:08,100
it won't end up that way.

2132
02:31:08,100 --> 02:31:09,100
If you do something

2133
02:31:09,100 --> 02:31:10,100
you don't really like,

2134
02:31:10,100 --> 02:31:15,100
you're probably not going to do it well.

2135
02:31:15,100 --> 02:31:20,100
What do you mean?

2136
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:24,100
Yes.

2137
02:31:24,100 --> 02:31:28,100
So when I went to Warner after that,

2138
02:31:28,100 --> 02:31:31,100
I had a friend who was an Amiga enthusiast

2139
02:31:31,100 --> 02:31:33,100
who was much older than me,

2140
02:31:33,100 --> 02:31:37,100
and he worked at some post house

2141
02:31:37,100 --> 02:31:39,100
and was doing some stuff with them,

2142
02:31:39,100 --> 02:31:41,100
and they had this problem.

2143
02:31:41,100 --> 02:31:46,100
They were working on an IMAX stereo movie

2144
02:31:46,100 --> 02:31:48,100
for their theme parks

2145
02:31:48,100 --> 02:31:51,100
called Marvin the Martian in 3D.

2146
02:31:51,100 --> 02:31:52,100
So this is like,

2147
02:31:52,100 --> 02:31:55,100
they didn't have stereo movies back then.

2148
02:31:55,100 --> 02:31:57,100
This is a fairly new thing that was added,

2149
02:31:57,100 --> 02:32:00,100
and they wanted to make a stereo movie

2150
02:32:00,100 --> 02:32:02,100
that looked exactly like it was hand drawn,

2151
02:32:02,100 --> 02:32:04,100
and they were very specific

2152
02:32:04,100 --> 02:32:07,100
about what Looney Tunes characters look like,

2153
02:32:07,100 --> 02:32:09,100
and they'd been trying to solve this problem

2154
02:32:09,100 --> 02:32:13,100
of making 3D graphics look like

2155
02:32:13,100 --> 02:32:14,100
it's hand drawn in that style

2156
02:32:14,100 --> 02:32:16,100
for like a year or two,

2157
02:32:16,100 --> 02:32:17,100
and it was unsolved.

2158
02:32:17,100 --> 02:32:20,100
They were basically having to hand touch up

2159
02:32:20,100 --> 02:32:22,100
and fix things,

2160
02:32:22,100 --> 02:32:25,100
which was a nightmare in stereo.

2161
02:32:25,100 --> 02:32:26,100
So I was 18 years old,

2162
02:32:26,100 --> 02:32:28,100
and my friend who was dealing with them

2163
02:32:28,100 --> 02:32:29,100
said, oh, I know a guy.

2164
02:32:29,100 --> 02:32:33,100
He can solve this for you,

2165
02:32:33,100 --> 02:32:36,100
and so he set up an interview,

2166
02:32:36,100 --> 02:32:39,100
and I'm like, what are you talking about?

2167
02:32:39,100 --> 02:32:40,100
I've never done anything.

2168
02:32:40,100 --> 02:32:42,100
He's like, no, no, you can do it.

2169
02:32:42,100 --> 02:32:44,100
He's like, just go do the interview.

2170
02:32:44,100 --> 02:32:47,100
So I interviewed, and they gave me the job,

2171
02:32:47,100 --> 02:32:50,100
and I solved it a few months later.

2172
02:32:50,100 --> 02:32:52,100
I published a technical sketch on that,

2173
02:32:52,100 --> 02:32:53,100
so as far as I know,

2174
02:32:53,100 --> 02:32:56,100
I'm the first one to have solved

2175
02:32:56,100 --> 02:33:00,100
the general problem of generating curvature,

2176
02:33:00,100 --> 02:33:04,100
lines based on curvature in Toon-like characters.

2177
02:33:04,100 --> 02:33:05,100
I built a whole system around it,

2178
02:33:05,100 --> 02:33:07,100
and we solved the problem,

2179
02:33:07,100 --> 02:33:10,100
and then right after that,

2180
02:33:10,100 --> 02:33:13,100
Disney, I ended up interviewing for them.

2181
02:33:13,100 --> 02:33:14,100
It was the same thing.

2182
02:33:14,100 --> 02:33:16,100
I was 20 years old,

2183
02:33:16,100 --> 02:33:20,100
and I couldn't drink legally yet,

2184
02:33:20,100 --> 02:33:22,100
but they interviewed me,

2185
02:33:22,100 --> 02:33:26,100
and I went through a series of people.

2186
02:33:26,100 --> 02:33:29,100
It was the head of software,

2187
02:33:29,100 --> 02:33:32,100
the visual effects supervisor,

2188
02:33:32,100 --> 02:33:33,100
the head of technology,

2189
02:33:33,100 --> 02:33:35,100
CTO of this group,

2190
02:33:35,100 --> 02:33:38,100
and the head of the whole studio,

2191
02:33:38,100 --> 02:33:39,100
and we all ended up in

2192
02:33:39,100 --> 02:33:41,100
the head of the studio's office at the end,

2193
02:33:41,100 --> 02:33:42,100
and they're like,

2194
02:33:42,100 --> 02:33:43,100
look, we can't tell you what movie this is,

2195
02:33:43,100 --> 02:33:46,100
but there's going to be a gorilla in the movie,

2196
02:33:46,100 --> 02:33:49,100
and we need to do fur for that,

2197
02:33:49,100 --> 02:33:51,100
and this is a real problem.

2198
02:33:51,100 --> 02:33:52,100
Disney is investing a lot of money.

2199
02:33:52,100 --> 02:33:57,100
It was like $20 million just for the effects budget

2200
02:33:57,100 --> 02:33:58,100
for that thing.

2201
02:33:58,100 --> 02:34:01,100
They're like, do you think you can do this?

2202
02:34:01,100 --> 02:34:02,100
I said, well, yeah,

2203
02:34:02,100 --> 02:34:05,100
I've kind of thought about this for a little bit.

2204
02:34:05,100 --> 02:34:08,100
I think you need to write a special renderer

2205
02:34:08,100 --> 02:34:10,100
to deal with the anti-aliasing problem,

2206
02:34:10,100 --> 02:34:11,100
and I said some stuff,

2207
02:34:11,100 --> 02:34:13,100
and so the head of production kicked everybody

2208
02:34:13,100 --> 02:34:15,100
out of the room,

2209
02:34:15,100 --> 02:34:17,100
and he's like, all right,

2210
02:34:17,100 --> 02:34:20,100
can you start now?

2211
02:34:20,100 --> 02:34:22,100
I said, hey, hold on a second.

2212
02:34:22,100 --> 02:34:27,100
I'm kind of making up stuff over here.

2213
02:34:27,100 --> 02:34:29,100
I'm not actually sure this will solve it.

2214
02:34:29,100 --> 02:34:30,100
He's like, it doesn't matter.

2215
02:34:30,100 --> 02:34:34,100
He's like, we've interviewed 13 people,

2216
02:34:34,100 --> 02:34:37,100
and all of them were too scared to do it,

2217
02:34:37,100 --> 02:34:39,100
and you're the only one that looked confident

2218
02:34:39,100 --> 02:34:40,100
enough.

2219
02:34:40,100 --> 02:34:42,100
He's like, I don't understand any of these things.

2220
02:34:42,100 --> 02:34:44,100
He's like, can you just start?

2221
02:34:44,100 --> 02:34:45,100
I said, well, let me tell you tomorrow.

2222
02:34:45,100 --> 02:34:47,100
Let me think about it over the night,

2223
02:34:47,100 --> 02:34:49,100
and so I drove home,

2224
02:34:49,100 --> 02:34:52,100
and it was a long drive because they had bought

2225
02:34:52,100 --> 02:34:54,100
this studio in Sini Valley,

2226
02:34:54,100 --> 02:34:56,100
which is way outside in Ventura County

2227
02:34:56,100 --> 02:34:58,100
from Los Angeles where I lived.

2228
02:34:58,100 --> 02:35:02,100
I stopped at a, I saw a Borders bookstore.

2229
02:35:02,100 --> 02:35:04,100
I stopped, and I bought a picture book

2230
02:35:04,100 --> 02:35:08,100
for children for gorillas,

2231
02:35:08,100 --> 02:35:09,100
and I didn't sleep all night.

2232
02:35:09,100 --> 02:35:11,100
I just stared at gorilla butts all night long

2233
02:35:11,100 --> 02:35:15,100
just to see, like, can I make that hair,

2234
02:35:15,100 --> 02:35:17,100
and in the morning, I called them up.

2235
02:35:17,100 --> 02:35:19,100
I said, you know, I think we can do it.

2236
02:35:19,100 --> 02:35:22,100
I wasn't sure, but I just told them that,

2237
02:35:22,100 --> 02:35:24,100
and we solved it and got nominated

2238
02:35:24,100 --> 02:35:28,100
for an Academy Award for visual effects for it

2239
02:35:28,100 --> 02:35:31,100
and applied the same algorithms I used

2240
02:35:31,100 --> 02:35:33,100
based on these froxels.

2241
02:35:33,100 --> 02:35:34,100
I think that was one of the first ones

2242
02:35:34,100 --> 02:35:36,100
to do that too with deep shadows

2243
02:35:37,100 --> 02:35:41,100
to general volumes and particles and whatnot,

2244
02:35:41,100 --> 02:35:44,100
and it was used on a whole bunch of movies there,

2245
02:35:44,100 --> 02:35:46,100
so I guess the moral of that one is just

2246
02:35:46,100 --> 02:35:48,100
sometimes you just take a risk.

2247
02:35:48,100 --> 02:35:50,100
You have to be confident in yourself,

2248
02:35:50,100 --> 02:35:54,100
and if you at least pretend you know

2249
02:35:54,100 --> 02:35:56,100
what you're doing, they might give you a job.

2250
02:36:01,100 --> 02:36:03,100
The truth is nobody really knows

2251
02:36:03,100 --> 02:36:05,100
the solution to unsolved problems,

2252
02:36:07,100 --> 02:36:10,100
so it's always going to be a risk.

2253
02:36:17,100 --> 02:36:18,100
There's one more.

2254
02:36:23,100 --> 02:36:24,100
Is NVIDIA hiring?

2255
02:36:24,100 --> 02:36:27,100
Well, we were hiring like crazy

2256
02:36:27,100 --> 02:36:30,100
up until this little downturn thing

2257
02:36:30,100 --> 02:36:31,100
started to happen.

2258
02:36:31,100 --> 02:36:33,100
My group, we hired a ton,

2259
02:36:33,100 --> 02:36:36,100
and I imagine most of you

2260
02:36:36,100 --> 02:36:38,100
would be a pretty good fit for it.

2261
02:36:38,100 --> 02:36:41,100
We're still hiring, but for specific roles,

2262
02:36:43,100 --> 02:36:47,100
go ahead and apply or at least contact me.

2263
02:36:47,100 --> 02:36:50,100
You know how to get to me through Shazam.

2264
02:36:50,100 --> 02:36:52,100
If you're really interested in working at NVIDIA

2265
02:36:52,100 --> 02:36:53,100
and working on Omniverse,

2266
02:36:53,100 --> 02:36:56,100
if it doesn't happen right now, maybe soon enough.

2267
02:36:56,100 --> 02:36:59,100
We'll see when the spigot opens up again,

2268
02:36:59,100 --> 02:37:00,100
all the hiring wrecks,

2269
02:37:00,100 --> 02:37:02,100
because it always cycles like this.

2270
02:37:11,100 --> 02:37:12,100
You interned?

2271
02:37:17,100 --> 02:37:18,100
Really?

2272
02:37:20,100 --> 02:37:22,100
You're on Brian's team?

2273
02:37:23,100 --> 02:37:24,100
Oh, really?

2274
02:37:25,100 --> 02:37:26,100
Okay.

2275
02:37:27,100 --> 02:37:29,100
That's why you're asking all those questions.

2276
02:37:31,100 --> 02:37:33,100
I didn't plant him there.

2277
02:37:33,100 --> 02:37:35,100
He was asking on his own.

2278
02:37:45,100 --> 02:37:46,100
Fantastic.

2279
02:37:47,100 --> 02:37:48,100
Fantastic.

2280
02:37:57,100 --> 02:37:59,100
We're going to take a break now.

2281
02:37:59,100 --> 02:38:01,100
We're going to check out.

2282
02:38:05,100 --> 02:38:07,100
If any of you have any thoughts to share,

2283
02:38:07,100 --> 02:38:09,100
please go ahead and talk to them.

2284
02:38:09,100 --> 02:38:10,100
Otherwise,

2285
02:38:14,100 --> 02:38:15,100
if you want to come chat,

2286
02:38:15,100 --> 02:38:16,100
Rev's here.

2287
02:38:19,100 --> 02:38:21,100
Adam's done a lot of work.

2288
02:38:23,100 --> 02:38:25,100
There's a lot of experience in this room

2289
02:38:25,100 --> 02:38:27,100
Rev, thank you so much for coming out.

2290
02:38:27,100 --> 02:38:28,100
Loved having you,

2291
02:38:28,100 --> 02:38:30,100
and hopefully we'll do this again next year.

2292
02:38:30,100 --> 02:38:33,100
Thank you so much for listening to my ramblings.

2293
02:38:35,100 --> 02:38:36,100
This is a lot of fun.

2294
02:38:36,100 --> 02:38:39,100
It's great to see so many passionate, smart people

2295
02:38:39,100 --> 02:38:41,100
who love the same thing I do,

2296
02:38:42,100 --> 02:38:43,100
all in the same room.

2297
02:38:43,100 --> 02:38:44,100
Thank you.
