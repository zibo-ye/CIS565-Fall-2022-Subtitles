1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
and stuff we can talk about.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,520
This meeting is being recorded.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,020
Hey.

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,340
So if I do an Intel talk or an NVIDIA talk,

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,580
if I was going to do that, now I haven't done an NVIDIA talk,

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:18,940
there's usually some kind of legal disclaimer in there.

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,280
We don't always have to give it.

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,700
Sometimes we give it in the back.

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,140
This is a personal legal disclaimer.

10
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,740
This talk represents knowledge and the sole opinions of me.

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:34,260
Don't represent NVIDIA or Intel Corporation in the slides

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,740
other than the stuff I've done that's public,

13
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,660
all that kind of stuff.

14
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,260
So sorry about the legal disclaimer.

15
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,740
This, as soon as you guys get jobs

16
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,380
and in any one of these companies,

17
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,060
this legality thing actually comes to play.

18
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:54,260
So it is a little bit of a career thing to be aware of.

19
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,820
Anyway, like I said, I just left Intel

20
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,300
the beginning of this month.

21
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:07,820
I had kind of a broad set of responsibilities,

22
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:10,220
effectively the general manager of anything

23
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,340
to do with professional visualization, ray tracing,

24
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,780
particularly on the software side.

25
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,020
But the team at the time that I had actually

26
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,460
helped and were significant in the design,

27
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:30,940
in the whole new Intel GPU line coming out, ARC.

28
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,860
And let's see, which ones am I allowed to say?

29
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,460
ARC.

30
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,060
And they announced one called Flex.

31
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,100
And there's another one to be announced.

32
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,620
But its code name is Ponte Vecchio, and that is public.

33
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,940
And that's going as an HPC device that's sort of,

34
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,860
if you know what an A100 is from NVIDIA,

35
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,300
it's the thing for that.

36
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,780
All those devices have ray tracing hardware.

37
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,780
And myself and my team together helped design the ray tracing

38
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,500
hardware.

39
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,700
And then that's being utilized both for real-time gaming ray

40
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,780
tracing, but also for professional rendering,

41
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,700
like Embree and OpenImageDenoise.

42
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,580
And I was the leader for rendering toolkit,

43
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,300
which had all those products.

44
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,540
Enough about Intel, because I'm not there anymore.

45
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,980
And then now, as Shazan said, I've just started.

46
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,220
And I'm bootstrapping.

47
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,620
And we can talk about what's even, you guys can ask me,

48
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,780
what's it like to switch companies?

49
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,460
Because it's a relatively big deal.

50
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,860
And yeah, so I've started that.

51
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,740
HPC is high-performance computing,

52
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,220
if you haven't heard that.

53
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,300
Supercomputing, high-performance computing.

54
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,060
And that's where the climate change stuff.

55
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,720
We'll talk a little bit more about that.

56
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,960
Enough of the legal upfront stuff.

57
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,080
I kind of have a legacy.

58
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,800
So you see the black and white pictures?

59
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,080
They're really black and white pictures.

60
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,120
These are my parents.

61
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,000
This is my father.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
They're passed away.

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,840
But my father was one of the pioneers

64
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,720
across the country in what we call cable TV.

65
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,880
Now you call it Verizon Fios.

66
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,960
It's fiber optic, all that stuff.

67
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,040
But my dad was one of the world's leading engineers

68
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,840
in delivering pixels to your home.

69
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,400
So there's kind of a DNA.

70
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,960
I'm the closest one in the family.

71
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,720
I'm the youngest one in the family.

72
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,080
And I'm the one who kind of ended up

73
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:37,320
pursuing a digital career where visual computing was there.

74
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:44,320
My dad graduated from Moore School of Engineering in 1949.

75
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,640
So don't please add any of that up and figure it out.

76
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,480
I'm the youngest, so I was born when he was 80.

77
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:59,160
So anyway, my daughter, class of 06, Sarah Jeffers.

78
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,120
I did not go here.

79
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,120
I went to LaSalle University.

80
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,280
So I'm still a Philadelphian.

81
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,760
My son-in-law, who's married to my daughter, in 05.

82
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,360
And my daughter-in-law, who's married to my son,

83
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,200
graduated from Penn in 10.

84
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,040
And then my mother, during the war,

85
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,400
actually was one of the early females who came to Penn.

86
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,480
She ended up only staying for a two-year stint

87
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,880
before the world got crazy enough

88
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,840
that she didn't complete her degree, but my dad did.

89
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,920
So pixels and pen go together.

90
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,960
I'm kind of a legacy, because I'm a legacy sandwich.

91
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,520
My daughter went here, and my father went there.

92
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,200
But anyway, love University of Pennsylvania.

93
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,640
I'm very aware of the campus, even though I'm late today.

94
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,080
I also am a huge Philadelphia Phillies and Eagles

95
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,320
and everything fan, so I run it.

96
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,360
OK, more about some of the stuff

97
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,840
that I have done and have been involved in.

98
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,320
This is a little bit of a one-page snapshot

99
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:17,040
of bits and pieces of my career, some of the interesting things.

100
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,440
If you look up in the middle, where it says,

101
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,560
do I have a little pointer?

102
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,520
Yes, the horizontal button.

103
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,520
Oh, wait.

104
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,360
That should be the one with the window.

105
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,520
That guy, that guy.

106
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,280
OK.

107
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,160
So as Shazan said, I live in the Philadelphia area.

108
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,960
I grew up in Flowertown.

109
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,600
If anybody heard of Chestnut Hill, it is the next town over.

110
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,800
It's the closest you can be without being in Philadelphia.

111
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,600
So I went to Springfield High School there.

112
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Grew up in Flowertown.

113
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,360
I mentioned my parents.

114
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,240
They lived in Flowertown my whole life,

115
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,920
all my brothers and sisters' whole life.

116
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,320
They were there for many, many years.

117
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,840
I now live in Yardley, Pennsylvania,

118
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,200
beautiful river town.

119
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,160
Feel free to visit it if you like Bucks County.

120
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,280
That's where it is.

121
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,600
But this is actually not my house,

122
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,720
but it's what's called Lake Afton, which

123
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,560
is really a pond in my house.

124
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,640
So anyway, Philadelphia, born, bred, continue.

125
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,160
Actually, two of my children and their families

126
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,680
also live in Yardley, so we're very close there.

127
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,560
Some cool stuff.

128
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,080
Why did I put up a football game?

129
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,560
Oh, wait.

130
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,120
It's not even the Eagles.

131
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,800
Is it the Eagles?

132
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,720
No, it's not the Eagles.

133
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,280
I worked on the technology behind this line here,

134
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,680
the first down line.

135
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,760
So any football fans who are watching the first down line

136
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,080
or whatever, I actually have a patent

137
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,240
on key parts of that technology.

138
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,800
Was really fun and great to work on.

139
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,680
Also, if you watch the Phillies game tonight

140
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,040
and look behind to the left of the batter,

141
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,400
you occasionally see they do a different thing.

142
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,040
And there's a green screen there.

143
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,160
But when the batter comes up, there's

144
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,560
an advertisement or something there.

145
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,480
Exact same technology.

146
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,120
Back in the day, I sat in a little truck

147
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,880
outside the Phillies game and ran the system

148
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,280
that did all that stuff.

149
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,080
So very interesting technology.

150
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,240
A lot of people, particularly American sports fans,

151
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,840
where it's mostly used, it's also

152
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,400
used sometimes in Olympic swimming

153
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,080
when they put the flags on the pit.

154
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,720
All this virtual technology derives.

155
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,320
And the patent, it says my name on it.

156
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,840
Everything I've done has been in a group setting.

157
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,840
I'm not some magic person or brilliant or whatever.

158
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,760
It's all about collaboration.

159
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,400
And that's something to keep in mind

160
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,200
as you continue your work.

161
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,720
And I know Shazam was talking to me about two and three person

162
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,200
projects.

163
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:09,720
That's actually a perfect thing to think about.

164
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,360
Let's see.

165
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,840
Shortly after the first down line,

166
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,680
we come down here, these funky little cameras.

167
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,360
Webcams are gone, pretty much.

168
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,120
They're built into your machines.

169
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,360
Obviously, we're using a camera up there.

170
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,640
But before webcams are in the machines,

171
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,920
there was various clever designs.

172
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,520
And the key thing that I worked on, actually,

173
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,800
a little less that camera.

174
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,200
This was to get cool looking cameras in people's hands.

175
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,960
This thing called Click Video Messenger.

176
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,120
It's Zoom 15, 18 years ago.

177
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,440
That's what it was.

178
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,240
Another thing to consider as you're in your careers

179
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,080
is, is the market ready for your technology?

180
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:04,360
You might be able to do it, but is the market ready?

181
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,240
And often, you don't know.

182
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,000
Was the market ready for an iPhone?

183
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,640
Apparently, it was, because they took off pretty quick.

184
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,480
But it really wasn't until the COVID pandemic and some stuff

185
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,800
before, like the FaceTime and everything,

186
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,360
where personal video conferencing.

187
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,400
And then it became so ubiquitous that personal video

188
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,800
conferencing became business video conferencing,

189
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,880
all with the use of tools and the internet and everything.

190
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,400
We had lots of challenges then, like internet bandwidth

191
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,480
and stuff that we saw.

192
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,920
Those challenges don't really exist anymore

193
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,120
in the world of gigabit capability.

194
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:51,640
So anyway, I did work on that, so pixels in the video realm.

195
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,680
And then, oh, whoops.

196
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,720
And as Shazan said, there's two of the four books

197
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,800
that I wrote jointly with James Reinders.

198
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,680
I actually have a text message from James.

199
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,200
He wanted to talk to me today.

200
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,640
But I didn't get a chance.

201
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,920
Back in the day, he mentioned an early stint at Intel,

202
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,880
Intel DVI technology.

203
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,640
That stands for Digital Video Interactive, not

204
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,000
the old display technology.

205
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,320
But that was in and around digital video,

206
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,800
kind of a precursor here.

207
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,080
I said this was the Xeon Phi time frame.

208
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,160
In between all that, I worked at a company in Newtown

209
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,920
called Seng Labs.

210
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,920
And they were actually pretty much the first, quote,

211
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,560
GPU country, company in the world, in the United States.

212
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,840
They glommed on.

213
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,120
And I joined them a significant way.

214
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,960
I didn't start it up or anything.

215
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,880
I joined them from Intel and actually worked

216
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,880
on DirectX 1.0, in fact, a little

217
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:12,160
hint is for cool thing that you stumble on in your career.

218
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,240
I was the first person ever to get a DirectX graphics driver

219
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:23,000
actually running with a graphics channel in prototype form.

220
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,600
So that was a cool thing.

221
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:32,400
And then down here, after the Xeon Phi time, I took over.

222
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,120
And this was mostly about high performance

223
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,240
computing and compute.

224
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,480
This was bringing those things together,

225
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:45,560
compute with ray tracing, video, things like that.

226
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,840
And one, I forgot to mention, a lot of people

227
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,760
aren't really aware that I was on a team that

228
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,720
won a technical Emmy award for downline technology.

229
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,080
That was a general award of multiple companies

230
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,040
and multiple people.

231
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,680
And then my team, with my support,

232
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,640
got for Embree, which hopefully you've heard of,

233
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,920
if you're into ray tracing at all,

234
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,600
got a 2020 Technical Achievement Award from the Academy

235
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,000
of Motion Pictures.

236
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And this all stems from Intel 1API rendering toolkit,

237
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,840
which until October was something that I led

238
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,160
and was responsible for.

239
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:31,660
OK.

240
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,400
Just to glom on that, what happens when you navigate

241
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:43,280
your career and you accidentally,

242
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:50,080
or as a little kid would say, by purpose or on purpose,

243
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,840
get to do some cool things?

244
00:12:52,840 --> 00:13:01,920
So DreamWorks has used Embree in their renderer Moonray.

245
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,320
So all the How to Train Your Dragon's movie,

246
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,320
any DreamWorks movie, television show that uses ray tracing

247
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,720
uses the technology that my team did.

248
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,040
And we built it hand-in-hand with DreamWorks.

249
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,280
And very cool, they just announced at SIGGRAPH

250
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:25,720
that they're open sourcing the whole package, Moonray.

251
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,160
So they'll be kind of a really, I'm not saying Blender

252
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,320
is not a real production, but Blender

253
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,920
is kind of used somewhere between hobbyist

254
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,640
and professional.

255
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,080
There's been movies like Next Gen done with Blender.

256
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,480
I'm not saying anything's bad.

257
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,560
But Moonray has literally put out Blockbuster.

258
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,680
Blockbuster movie set will be going open source soon.

259
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,440
Visual effects on top of it, the Marvel movies,

260
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,160
things like that.

261
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,520
The other cool thing that I like about renderers,

262
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,840
because I also like this about high-performance computing,

263
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,400
is they like naming their renderers.

264
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,680
So Moonray was the name for DreamWorks renderer.

265
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,000
Freak is the name for Framestore's renderer.

266
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,880
You may not have heard much about Framestore,

267
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,520
but they're one of the top special effects companies.

268
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,880
And obviously, they've done a lot in the Spider-Man, Marvel

269
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,380
movies.

270
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,040
Other cool movies using the technology,

271
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,640
The Lens from Animal Logic has been possibly

272
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,080
the longest Embree customer there is.

273
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:43,520
They took something called Embree 1.3,

274
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,360
and integrated it into Glimpse and all the Lego movies

275
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,800
and stuff like that.

276
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,280
V-Ray is another renderer rendering bolt-on.

277
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,800
You can bolt it on to RenderMan.

278
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,320
You can bolt it on to Arnold.

279
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,320
Utilize it in various ways.

280
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,000
And these are just some of the movies.

281
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,880
Actually, I pulled an old slide to make sure

282
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,920
that I was legally doing something new.

283
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,520
So these are 2017 and 2018 designed movies,

284
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,000
as well as this well-known Nintendo

285
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,960
that was completely crafted from V-Ray.

286
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,240
Again, partners.

287
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,520
We're enabling partners, giving them technology,

288
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,760
and really cool technology to get them performance

289
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,560
and capability that basically they

290
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,680
don't have to design themselves.

291
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,720
And the other thing, and Jason mentioned it,

292
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,080
is open source.

293
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,120
Everything that I've worked on most recently

294
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,080
has been open source.

295
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,920
We'll see how that goes.

296
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,480
If I can interrupt you, do you have a favorite movie,

297
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,400
a favorite incident you remember,

298
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,080
anything where you were like, oh, I go in,

299
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,400
or your team goes in and changes the game for the studios?

300
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,360
That is a fantastic question, and the answer is I don't know.

301
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,120
Why is my answer I don't know?

302
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,680
Does anyone know why my answer is I don't know?

303
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,320
Because the intellectual property of the movie

304
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,440
is the 3D models.

305
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,400
So they don't give them to us.

306
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,880
They would send us a problem outside.

307
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,120
We knew it was a movie.

308
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,880
One of the teams that we worked mostly with us,

309
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,960
like we knew they were working on a movie.

310
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,880
We knew they had to finish it in three weeks.

311
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,880
And they would go, I ran into problem X,

312
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,160
or I'd like Embry to extend this so we don't

313
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,120
have to do it or whatever.

314
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,920
And that is Illumination.

315
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,640
So Sing, Sing 2, Secret Life of Pets, The Minions,

316
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,800
all that stuff.

317
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,760
We probably got an email connection with them weekly.

318
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,640
And they're working on two or three movies.

319
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,120
The Grinch, all that kind.

320
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,160
The Grinch was the first movie that they really

321
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,760
fully integrated that one.

322
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:12,240
But the answer is we never know until after the movie's out.

323
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,680
So we don't have that cool factor when we're doing it.

324
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,280
Yes?

325
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,000
So are you allowed to say it was a Mario movie?

326
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,480
No.

327
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,480
The answer is, one, I'm not allowed.

328
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,280
And two, I don't know anything about it.

329
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,520
It's the same thing.

330
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,840
We know they're using it.

331
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,160
So the only thing I would have been

332
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,520
able to say, which I can't say because of Intel

333
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,040
confidentiality, which I'm still responsible for,

334
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,200
is I could say, hey, they were trying

335
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,480
to do this kind of motion blur with this element

336
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:52,920
or whatever, or they were, hair and fur is a huge,

337
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,720
continues to be a huge compute problem.

338
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,360
But it is the thing that really adds

339
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,000
that natural, realistic feel.

340
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,880
They really want the hair to flow,

341
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,640
like hair and everything else.

342
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,560
And then motion blur and hair and all these other things

343
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,680
come into play.

344
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,480
But the bottom line is, no, I can't tell you

345
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,400
about the Mario movie.

346
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,760
I can't tell you almost about any movie,

347
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,520
not because of NDA, although that's part of it,

348
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,120
is they don't tell us.

349
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,600
They don't tell us what movie it is.

350
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:30,720
There is one movie that I'll bring it up in a,

351
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,000
actually, I'll bring it up in a second

352
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,000
that I believe I can mention because they said it out loud

353
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,800
at SIGGRAPH.

354
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,960
But it's kind of a cool movie from Pixar

355
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,960
that's going to come out.

356
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:52,280
And interestingly, Pixar is the most constrained organization

357
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,680
on the planet, which you can understand that.

358
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:59,520
They have really, really cool technology.

359
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,680
Actually, here it is.

360
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:06,360
So this is not a Pixar movie, but this is RenderMan.

361
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,520
And this is RenderMan.

362
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,720
This is kind of the last technology thing

363
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,680
I and my team at Intel were deeply involved in

364
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:20,120
was integrating what's called the volume kernel library.

365
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:27,280
And in graphics, in film graphics in general,

366
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,400
what's called volume rendering is growing leaps and bounds,

367
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,240
a really important thing.

368
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,080
Does everyone know what volume rendering is?

369
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,560
Do you have a sense of what it is?

370
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,800
And if people don't like that.

371
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,000
I think most of you have done at least a volumetric render,

372
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,500
right?

373
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,400
Some form like Perlin noise, those kind of things?

374
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,040
Yeah.

375
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,560
Probably on a much smaller scale.

376
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,880
Of course, small scale.

377
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,680
But basically, your 3D environment

378
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,520
is truly in a 3D box.

379
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:05,800
It's not described as a 3D location and then an object.

380
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,560
It's actually typically amorphous,

381
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,480
like fire, smoke, things that don't make sense

382
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,360
to boil down into triangles.

383
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:20,160
Actually, the pixels and their color and their transparency

384
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,000
are kind of explained in a true 3D space.

385
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,600
And that's the volume.

386
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,280
And then you shoot rays through it.

387
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,520
And there you may do things like multi-hit.

388
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,840
Hit one, hit one, hit one, where normally you

389
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,760
do single hit and bounce on geometry.

390
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:45,640
So Embree is a geometric tool kit or tool.

391
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,160
Open volume kernel library is the Embree for volumes.

392
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,760
And the reason I brought up Pixar

393
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:56,920
is Pixar is working on a movie called Elementals.

394
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,320
And the characters are all volumetric.

395
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,160
Fire is one of the characters.

396
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,680
So that's the reason I know about it

397
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,920
and why I can mention it, because volume rendering is

398
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:12,520
going to be a huge part of the rendering of that movie.

399
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,400
I'm going to now switch gears a little.

400
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,480
Movies are cool.

401
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,880
It's been great.

402
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,080
You asked me a bunch of exciting, exciting photos I did.

403
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,680
Oh, OK.

404
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,520
We'll cut that.

405
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:33,280
And let's show them.

406
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,280
Oh, I see.

407
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:34,780
I see.

408
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,280
This guy.

409
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,280
What happened?

410
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,760
Do this.

411
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,600
Shouldn't be able to charge that whole thing.

412
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,200
Because I think it's good.

413
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,640
OK.

414
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,440
OK, we're back.

415
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,480
Switch gears a little bit, because I

416
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,760
think this is a GPU programming course.

417
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,720
It's not necessarily a full-blown graphics course.

418
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,960
Obviously, visual computing is involved.

419
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,600
But one, the area I'm going into,

420
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,520
but an area that has really been exciting for me

421
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,720
to get involved in is supercomputing,

422
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,800
scientific visualization, scientific computing

423
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,080
to get to the visualization.

424
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:36,520
And I have had the benefit of doing things like working

425
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,720
and meeting Stephen Hawking.

426
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,280
And now he has passed away a few years ago.

427
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,160
Actually, was invited and attended

428
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,200
his memorial ceremony.

429
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,920
And I continue to work with that team.

430
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,640
So I'm going to just see if I can make this move.

431
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,520
A neutron star is created by a massive star collapsing

432
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,520
in on itself.

433
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,480
It is estimated to be sort of the size of our sun,

434
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:13,120
compressed down to just the size of a city, like Rome.

435
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,600
The spiraling dance of these two massive objects

436
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,560
dramatically stirred up space-time

437
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,360
and simulated a very specific pattern of gravitational waves

438
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,880
that the LICO detectors picked up.

439
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:29,200
So that's a brief segment.

440
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,640
That last little part where the split screen was here,

441
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,880
this you saw Intel Osprey under there.

442
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,440
That was actually a simulation.

443
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,720
Everything else was like dialed up.

444
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,840
The first part and everything was done by an artist,

445
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,680
just doing it.

446
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,760
But that was mathematically correct.

447
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:56,160
And the thing on the right of two neutron or dark matter

448
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,480
stars hitting each other.

449
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,840
And they know that that happens because they detected it

450
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:10,160
on the LIGO detector, which in 2015, 2016

451
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,280
was a Nobel Prize winner.

452
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:19,200
And then the Hawking team and scientists around the world,

453
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,760
it's a two-sided thing.

454
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:29,520
They attempt to simulate the cosmological and Einstein

455
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,960
gravitational capability, visualize it,

456
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,640
make sure that's used in three different ways,

457
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,200
the visualization.

458
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,120
One is to just, is my code working?

459
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,680
Is it doing something interesting?

460
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,560
So debugging.

461
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,480
And then they use it to detect the science

462
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,520
and interesting artifacts.

463
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,680
Once they validate that it seems to work,

464
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,040
then they're looking at the gravitational waves.

465
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:01,560
And then they can communicate to the LIGO people

466
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,360
and say, if it works the way we think,

467
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,320
you change your detector to do this.

468
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,640
So it's pretty cool.

469
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,680
Other, again, we've worked with hundreds,

470
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,200
but these are the pretty cool.

471
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,640
This is a thing we've done with NASA Ames.

472
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,160
This is computational fluid dynamics,

473
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:33,040
a code they call LAVA, is generating this.

474
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:38,120
They're doing particle volume rendering here.

475
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,360
And NASA does more than just shoot things into space.

476
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,200
They analyze aircraft, all sorts of things like that.

477
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,880
That's what's going on here.

478
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,880
They're showing how a landing gear impacts

479
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,600
and the data flows around it.

480
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,400
And again, there's compute code.

481
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
Eventually, there is code.

482
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,760
But cool stuff you get to work on

483
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,120
if you work in high-performance computing.

484
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,280
And it's not necessarily all about science or cosmology

485
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,960
or space.

486
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,080
This is Bentley.

487
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,640
Now, I don't think any of us are going to go out and buy one,

488
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,480
but it represents a high-end car brand.

489
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:26,200
And the concept here is to think about Bentley

490
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,600
is it's all about customer service for them.

491
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,400
It's also, they have almost no dealerships.

492
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,920
They have one dealership in London.

493
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,880
Now, you can think, well, if you can afford one,

494
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,880
you'll just fly there and do it.

495
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,200
That's not what people do.

496
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,720
They order Bentleys online.

497
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,160
That's what they do.

498
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:45,960
So they want to, we're working with us

499
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,880
to provide the utmost in photo-real experiences.

500
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,280
So this is a tool that we created with Bentley.

501
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,440
And as you can see, you can pop cars in and out.

502
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,120
You see, actually, some of the Monte Carlo.

503
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,920
The denoisers wasn't on.

504
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,200
In this case, this is convergence.

505
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,760
It's not with Open Image Denoise.

506
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,480
We have a later version that has the denoiser in there.

507
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,400
But it's not great on a projected screen.

508
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,400
It's a little better on the monitor here.

509
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:26,520
But you see how the realism of ray tracing

510
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,280
can come into play.

511
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,920
By the way, just so you know, no GPU was harmed in this.

512
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,960
This is all CPU.

513
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,440
This is all CPU-based rendering.

514
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:47,520
So be aware that CPUs are still pretty good at stuff

515
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,800
and usable.

516
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:56,080
And from an Intel perspective, which is public,

517
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,840
they're looking at platform computing.

518
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,200
But so is NVIDIA.

519
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,920
NVIDIA's coming out with CPUs.

520
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,800
Anyway, this just gives you a sense of the type of things

521
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,240
we could do.

522
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,840
This is actually three to four years old now.

523
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,840
Again, I reached back in the archives.

524
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,360
So I didn't have stuff.

525
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,200
We've done more with Bentley and everything.

526
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,760
And we're mapping all this stuff for who

527
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:23,280
were Intel with us to use our GPUs that were coming out.

528
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,640
Jim, I think Shobham, one of my PAs, has a question.

529
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,280
Yes.

530
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,280
Oh, I like your shirt.

531
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,040
I didn't see that.

532
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,000
This is a thin GPU, right?

533
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,200
Did you buy one of these thin GPUs?

534
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,880
This one, yeah.

535
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,880
This one was done, this setup was

536
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:49,840
done with eight nodes of dual socket.

537
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,760
Again, though, of an age of about four years.

538
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,880
And I'll talk about that a little bit.

539
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,880
So that's the cool stuff.

540
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,840
Let's see if I can move on.

541
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,440
There we go.

542
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,200
Guess what?

543
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,160
The rest of the presentation looked like this.

544
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,720
So I gave you all the cool stuff up front.

545
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,640
And now we're just talking about the GPUs.

546
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,240
And now we're just going to talk, OK?

547
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:34,480
And talk a little bit about, what's

548
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,000
it really like to try to craft that stuff?

549
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,760
What do you have to, what should you be aware of?

550
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,440
What should you know?

551
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:51,400
What considerations are there when writing and deploying

552
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:51,920
code?

553
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:56,320
Because everything I showed you pretty much was a product,

554
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,880
was deployable.

555
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:02,160
So the first thing is, I wasn't here necessarily

556
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,400
to impress you how great I am.

557
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,160
I'm not that great.

558
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:11,680
I had a combination of opportunities

559
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,760
and grabbed those opportunities when

560
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,640
I could to work with some of the top people in the world.

561
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,040
And some of it was grabbing.

562
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:24,160
And some of it was them asking and just getting yourself

563
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,640
in a position to do that.

564
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,840
So maybe you're somewhat impressed.

565
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,800
I'm really, really cool.

566
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,480
That's what everyone tells me.

567
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,320
But what does it have to do with this?

568
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:44,920
And the answer is, none of it would

569
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:51,560
work without real, concentrated, deep software engineering

570
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,280
capability.

571
00:30:53,280 --> 00:31:01,760
So I've coined this little three-word thing

572
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,000
that I try to keep in mind and try

573
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
to keep the teams that I work with in mind

574
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,120
and my partners in mind.

575
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,960
Quality, fidelity, and performance.

576
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,000
None of those products, if we didn't have all three

577
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
of those, I wouldn't be here today.

578
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,840
I wouldn't be able to talk to you

579
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:28,200
about Hawking or DreamWorks or any of that cool stuff

580
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:36,400
because that's the key thing to get things in people's hands,

581
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:42,400
to take your ideas, your knowledge, your coding.

582
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:49,440
You need to keep this in mind as you enter the workforce.

583
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,720
There's a continuum, of course.

584
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:59,640
My career, I would say I've been focused on products.

585
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,280
I've been focused on things that people

586
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:07,080
will touch in some form or fashion.

587
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,800
Millions of moviegoers, millions of television folks.

588
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,720
Now, it's also touching the thousands

589
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,520
of people running the TV show and everything as well.

590
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:25,280
But I have seen my own code go south watching TV.

591
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,280
Seen the first airline fly off the screen.

592
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,120
Stuff like that.

593
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,120
You don't want that to happen.

594
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:35,600
You usually, I'll mention something

595
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,360
in a second about the TV thing, which

596
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,520
was one of the best pieces of advice I got.

597
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,760
And made me feel better, I'll tell you in a second.

598
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,480
But quality, fidelity, performance.

599
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,280
If you take anything away from this talk today,

600
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,760
keep that in mind as you do your work.

601
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,000
It's a little less rigorous here, I'm not sure.

602
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,040
You're probably not going to fail if you have a bug, right?

603
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:14,240
But that mindset can really make a huge difference

604
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,720
in how you're perceived as an individual,

605
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:23,560
how your team is perceived, and the usage in the marketplace.

606
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:28,200
So what I call product software engineering practices

607
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,560
are critical.

608
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,280
You can go by the books.

609
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,680
I'm sure you've seen the books in software engineering

610
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,440
and been taught things.

611
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,880
The key for me is to pick the things that

612
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,280
map to the job at hand.

613
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,520
There's not just one way to do agile.

614
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:49,280
There's not just one way to do software engineering.

615
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:54,040
You apply it to the circumstances that you're in.

616
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:58,720
That's something that you learn as you go.

617
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,160
It's perfectly good to fall back on do this, do this, do this,

618
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,240
do this checklist, all that stuff.

619
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,200
That's perfectly fine, but we'll

620
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:13,320
come across something that we'll get at in a second.

621
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:18,000
But if you have proprietary license software,

622
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,600
there's a thought, or has been a traditional thought,

623
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:29,000
oh my god, that has to be by far the best quality,

624
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,040
because people are paying for it and everything.

625
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,200
And that's true, OK?

626
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,640
But open source software is no free lunch.

627
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:44,600
To me, it actually is a slightly higher bar, potentially,

628
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,360
than proprietary software.

629
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:50,760
With proprietary software, you get the opportunity

630
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,640
to do some crazy workaround to get it out.

631
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,760
You can hide your dirty laundry.

632
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,640
You can hide your dirty laundry.

633
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,960
Open source is open, right?

634
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,440
So the practices fit both things.

635
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,280
There's no free lunch.

636
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,160
Open source, which many of you will be involved in,

637
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:17,760
because it's so prevalent now and growing,

638
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,360
you really need to consider that.

639
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,240
Like I say, your personal ability and the company

640
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,320
reputation is fully exposed.

641
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,760
A line of code that has a security problem that's

642
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:36,280
completely obvious, all that stuff is there.

643
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:40,000
I don't mention security in this talk,

644
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,240
and I probably should have, because the security practices

645
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,720
around both proprietary and open source software

646
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,480
are a important and critical factor.

647
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,440
So you will immediately, in any company,

648
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,280
you go in, particularly a large, publicly traded

649
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:04,800
company, be prepared for two weeks of security training.

650
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,160
Now, I don't want to discourage you

651
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,800
from doing pet projects and this cool stuff and everything.

652
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,840
Just make sure you're crystal clear that it's a toy,

653
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:24,080
or I didn't do everything you're supposed to do, whatever.

654
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,920
Just be open about what you're doing

655
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,920
if you want to get feedback.

656
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,560
But it's better to follow some form of practices

657
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,400
than just throw it against the wall,

658
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,120
would be my recommendation.

659
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,800
Because maybe you really have a brilliant idea.

660
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,240
It's just like, you go, ah, it's a pain in the butt for me.

661
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,240
Every time I do this, I have to build that, build that,

662
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,760
build that.

663
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,240
I created a tool to do it.

664
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,600
You go, well, maybe other people could use it.

665
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,680
Oh, no, if that thing goes viral,

666
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,320
either you've got to pull it, which people don't like,

667
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,160
or you're committed to supporting it.

668
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:12,520
So just be aware that code quality and usages,

669
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,480
think about the software engineering practices

670
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,640
as you go do it.

671
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,560
Again, not trying to block you from anything.

672
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,720
But if you're in a company and you're developing open source,

673
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:26,720
that's aligned with a product, you will have higher bars.

674
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,320
And I will tell you that Intel, I haven't found out

675
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,520
what NVIDIA does, but I can tell because of all the training

676
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:37,440
I've gotten already in two days, the open source

677
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,640
had three or four more bars to get through, committees

678
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,320
and reviews and all this stuff.

679
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,680
And did you do this?

680
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,480
Did you do that?

681
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,600
Is there a security review?

682
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,000
So just be aware of that.

683
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,280
And if and only if you want to pick one of the above,

684
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,640
you basically don't have a usable thing unless it has quality.

685
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,240
It's pretty obvious.

686
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:07,160
However, I really put them together

687
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:12,840
as three equal partners in developing software.

688
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,200
I'll talk about each one.

689
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,640
Jim, if I can interrupt you first

690
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,920
to pick on the open source software part.

691
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,560
You've really seen the industry grow.

692
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,880
You were there when Linux came about.

693
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,760
You've seen Microsoft in its we hate Linux kind of fashion.

694
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,960
And now they've very much adopted Linux

695
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,440
and adopted open source.

696
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,240
Yes.

697
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,920
So maybe if you can just share your thoughts

698
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,800
on how open source has evolved and become industry standard

699
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,200
essentially and how if you're building a product that

700
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,760
is an industry standard that people want you to open source

701
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,360
it and maybe some advice to a student.

702
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,840
So a lot of the projects we do in the class,

703
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,160
I ask them to put on GitHub to be like, hey,

704
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,680
you don't have to package this and send it to your interview.

705
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,680
It's already there.

706
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,840
Exactly.

707
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,400
So maybe just your thoughts on that.

708
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,800
Please don't say, hey, Jim said I

709
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,720
don't have to do all that GitHub crap.

710
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,440
No, you should do what is on there.

711
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:18,560
Yeah, I mean, what I think is the good news

712
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,840
is it's become a virtuous cycle.

713
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,560
I think when it first came out, it had shareware

714
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,080
and you had to write a $5 check or whatever.

715
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:31,720
And you want to reward the people who put out

716
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:36,280
tools and capabilities.

717
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,480
At the same time where there was like,

718
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,320
is this somebody in their garage at midnight

719
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:48,920
who will never answer, the whole support infrastructure

720
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,400
had become probably the thing that would slow it down.

721
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:59,400
But through the community and open source,

722
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:04,160
there are so many tools like GitHub, GitLab,

723
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,240
that provide the software engineering capability

724
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,080
that you can utilize.

725
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:14,280
And I'm going to be blunt with you.

726
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:20,040
I don't think anyone in this room wants to be,

727
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,640
you want to be the best.

728
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,760
You want to be the best, write the highest quality code.

729
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,440
That's what your desire is.

730
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,000
So you migrate towards those tools

731
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,320
that allow you to do that and sustain your code

732
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,640
and all that kind of thing.

733
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:39,320
And it's just grown because then the community comes in.

734
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,680
I view open sources, there's a couple

735
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:45,520
of facets to open source.

736
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,600
And what's interesting is, as I would say,

737
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,680
my Intel team that was doing open source

738
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,200
was kind of a little bit far to the right,

739
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:58,320
like in one end of open source.

740
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:03,600
And those facets are, it's a community code in everybody.

741
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,120
Everybody and anybody can contribute to it.

742
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,360
And there is enough infrastructure.

743
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:16,400
And there is Alina's tour holds or somebody watching over

744
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,400
and not letting bad stuff get in and everything.

745
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,560
And those projects go really, really, really well.

746
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,600
And of course, the huge benefit for companies

747
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,960
is a lot of those things are solving problems

748
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:36,320
that are just a pain in the butt.

749
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,600
They're just, they're cool things,

750
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,960
they're tools and everything else.

751
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,560
But then the company can incorporate that,

752
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:49,320
even if they have proprietary code or their secret sauce,

753
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,640
as you will.

754
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,280
The things that aren't secret sauce, they can just,

755
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,280
they don't need to work on.

756
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,160
They have a built-in army to go help it.

757
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,520
And they can submit it.

758
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,440
Or the other thing is, is they have a measure of control.

759
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,480
If it breaks, they can go fix it.

760
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,200
They're not counting on this proprietary library,

761
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,600
this, that, the other thing.

762
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,440
So the virtuous cycle occurred.

763
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,640
It kind of, in the beginning, it was a cool thing,

764
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,280
a little bit of spaghetti against the wall.

765
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,160
Then people realizing they could do it.

766
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,360
And now it's a business.

767
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,520
There's a business reason to do it.

768
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:33,720
You don't have to write that code or deal with that code

769
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,200
so much.

770
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,920
At the same time, you still have to scan the code.

771
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,360
You still have to do all sorts of stuff.

772
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:44,000
They have, at Intel, they have whitelists and blacklists.

773
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Things that have security problems, can't use them.

774
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,200
Write it yourself.

775
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,760
There's all this kind of stuff.

776
00:42:49,800 --> 00:43:00,960
But the virtuous cycle and that openness,

777
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,280
it's a little bit self-monitoring.

778
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,960
Because you don't want to be called out

779
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,320
for bad code, everything else.

780
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,000
So you do concentrate it.

781
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,640
So that's it.

782
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,600
By the way, the other side of the coin that my team did

783
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:23,000
is we were a team who wrote code on behalf of Intel.

784
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,640
That was Intel production code that

785
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,720
happened to be open source.

786
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:36,280
While we accepted contributions, they were more than curated.

787
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,840
They were either solicited or solicited by the other side.

788
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,040
And then we would take control and commit

789
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,160
to supporting code from third party sources and everything.

790
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,720
That person never had to do it again.

791
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,120
If they were willing to commit, they would do it.

792
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,800
So 95% of the code in the stuff we did

793
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,280
was written by Intel, written by the Intel team.

794
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,080
How that benefited people like DreamWorks and everything

795
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:07,760
was, if Intel made a business decision

796
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:12,800
to stop working on that code, they still had access.

797
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,880
They could make that.

798
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:20,480
So it was good for Intel in their arena to do it.

799
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,320
But me, my team, we were so oriented

800
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,280
towards quality, fidelity, and performance

801
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,680
that we wanted to maintain that control.

802
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,480
And so that's the two sides of the coin.

803
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,080
No, that was beautiful.

804
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,920
To your last point, in the industry,

805
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,560
that's essentially called supplier risk.

806
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:43,440
Essentially, if you're depending on a software or service

807
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:49,000
where you agree to pay x amount of dollars, let's take Penn.

808
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,840
As you entered university, you agreed to pay a certain amount

809
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,960
for your tuition.

810
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,360
If Penn suddenly went, oh, you need to pay 2x now,

811
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,160
that's a risk you're taking on.

812
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:02,680
So having open source and at least open source available,

813
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,000
even if the company decides to pull it out,

814
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,880
you still have the ability to take it over

815
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:08,880
and build it in-house.

816
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,000
So it reduces supplier risk.

817
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,240
Yeah, I think the other thing, which

818
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,720
I think the focus of engineers and everything

819
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:23,320
is not necessarily unless you aspire to open your own business

820
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:30,320
or do your own thing is what I don't think has happened

821
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,600
is there's not one settled business

822
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,760
model for open source.

823
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,120
There are companies that just do open source.

824
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,840
There's a company called Kitware that had them on the thing.

825
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,200
Everything they do is open source,

826
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,720
but they're a contracting firm.

827
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:53,000
So they take in feature requests from the government

828
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,120
and everything, and they've built a model around that.

829
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,480
And then the question is, is how sustainable that?

830
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,520
That gives sort of an up and down sustainability

831
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,760
of the business.

832
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,280
Red Hat's another one.

833
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:08,160
They package it, they add value, and then

834
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,520
they craft a support license.

835
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,920
That's still a struggle in the industry.

836
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,720
The cool thing is it's pretty open to how

837
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,560
you might achieve that.

838
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:24,000
So anyway, that's that.

839
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,680
Let's make my go quicker.

840
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,000
It's not working very well.

841
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,440
Maybe I beat on it too much.

842
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:34,040
Get your laptop turned off.

843
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:34,760
I turned it off.

844
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,960
I'm sorry.

845
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:43,480
So quality, you've probably all heard of CI,

846
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:47,240
continuous integration, Agile techniques.

847
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,200
I'm not going to give you the whole book on Agile

848
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,720
as I just said.

849
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,240
What I have encountered and think

850
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,240
works in most circumstances.

851
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,800
And it'll work with often with you'll

852
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:06,640
use open source tools to build proprietary code as well

853
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,520
as open source.

854
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:16,920
So the continuous integration things I've seen, Jenkins,

855
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:21,280
there's a bunch of open source and a few other things.

856
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,760
My experience, though, is they all need to be customized.

857
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,080
It depends on what you're building,

858
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,920
why you're building it, who your users are,

859
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:32,760
how it's distributed, and what your mechanism is.

860
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:36,040
So that's why I say homegrown scripting.

861
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,320
It's kind of you're probably going to have both.

862
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,120
You're going to do that.

863
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,320
You're going to use a thing, again,

864
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:48,080
from Kitware called CMake to script

865
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,960
how you do various things.

866
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,560
But the concept of continuous integration, you make a change

867
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,200
and fully test everything.

868
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:02,200
One is easy to say and extremely hard to achieve.

869
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,800
And you're always one of those things

870
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,160
that you're reaching higher to do it.

871
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,880
But your software engineering practices

872
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,280
should always consider an automated continuous

873
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,160
integration.

874
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,800
JIRA, you'll encounter.

875
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:22,440
JIRA seems to be the one of the day now for bug and task

876
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,000
tracking.

877
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:31,120
I, in my mind, separate the two, but you don't have to.

878
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:34,400
But you really should think about the task

879
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,680
you're going to do, estimate it.

880
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,680
All that is real world stuff you'll

881
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:43,080
encounter when you enter a company.

882
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:49,040
You will have to spend not inordinate but not

883
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,560
minimal amount of time just tracking what you do.

884
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:55,600
So it's more of a career pointing out.

885
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,920
You're going to be an engineer.

886
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:57,600
Be aware.

887
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,680
You're going to have to write down what you're doing.

888
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:03,560
And somebody is going to either want to monitor it.

889
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:06,360
The best engineers I've found like to do it

890
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,640
because they monitor themselves.

891
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,840
And they don't care if anybody else is monitoring it.

892
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:14,200
It helps them focus on what they're doing.

893
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:18,720
So tasks and bug trackers will be critical to any job

894
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,480
you take.

895
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,240
Probably, if I can add, probably one

896
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:24,520
of the most underrated skills, especially for new grads

897
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,360
coming out, is how do you prioritize?

898
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,600
How do you prioritize without your manager telling you

899
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,200
what the priority is?

900
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,720
And if you can solve that, you're

901
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,120
going up the ladder very quickly.

902
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:39,400
That is a great, great point.

903
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:44,880
Independence, I'm actually going to bring it up later

904
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,880
in a different way.

905
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,440
And it may look like it's counterintuitive.

906
00:49:50,440 --> 00:50:02,880
But crafting an independence in yourself in everyday tasks

907
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,280
will be extremely useful to you and your manager.

908
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,680
And the minimum is never get in a,

909
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,560
I don't know what to do next.

910
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,880
That's probably, it's OK.

911
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,400
It happens.

912
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:21,400
But if you've got a plan for the next month,

913
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,840
and this is kind of where Agile comes in.

914
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:28,120
My team did roughly a combination

915
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:32,160
of monthly and quarterly planning.

916
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,360
So this tiered planning, what do I

917
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,600
want to achieve in a quarter?

918
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,600
What do I want to achieve this month?

919
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,760
Many teams do want to do this thing called sprints.

920
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,960
We didn't do it.

921
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,560
It didn't work for us.

922
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,280
Sprints weren't a thing that was good.

923
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,960
I'm not saying.

924
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:52,240
I would say probably 80%, 75% of companies do sprints.

925
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,640
That's what I meant by you have to take the Agile

926
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,040
as a bunch of tools, a bunch of screwdrivers and things,

927
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:58,640
and do it.

928
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:04,440
So one, keep that in mind.

929
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,800
The thing that I think is most important

930
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,640
that I've seen work the best is what I call here

931
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,240
incremental test-driven development.

932
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:19,280
In simple terms, write the test before you write the code.

933
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,320
Not the other way around.

934
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:30,920
You can benefit from that by modularizing or consolidating.

935
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:35,040
Just do a little thing, and test back and forth.

936
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:39,280
And even if you're pressured, you feel like, oh,

937
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,320
I've got to write a boatload of code.

938
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:48,360
101% of the time, you'll be slower doing it that way

939
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:51,560
than if you do test-driven development.

940
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:55,840
And you'll have less what's called technical debt.

941
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:59,120
Technical debt is the combination

942
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:02,600
of your code and the number of bugs you introduced into it.

943
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,840
And so you want to avoid technical debt.

944
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:10,360
And where Agile is, I'll get you in a second,

945
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,440
where some of the Agile books and everything

946
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,360
are completely correct.

947
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:20,080
It is roughly a 10x cost for every stage that you go out.

948
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,040
Yes, sir.

949
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:27,440
So last year, as part of the speaker

950
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,480
we brought in for the game design club,

951
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:35,280
we spoke with a programmer named Val.

952
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,360
And this is not necessarily like test cases,

953
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:45,720
but he says the way that he codes is he writes it all out.

954
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:50,640
And then he sets a debug point on all of them.

955
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:54,920
He never runs the code directly to see how it goes.

956
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:59,840
He just goes from breakpoint to breakpoint to breakpoint.

957
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,840
He calls it Zen programming.

958
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,520
Is that applicable?

959
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:10,160
So what I would say is we're all humans.

960
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,680
So that's a form of test-driven development.

961
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,120
He just went against my recommendation

962
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,720
in the sense of writing all the code.

963
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:22,640
Except he didn't really, because he put a debug point in,

964
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:26,280
and he focused on the code quality and situation

965
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,920
at every breakpoint.

966
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:33,520
So I actually think we're in violent agreement with him

967
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,880
in one sense.

968
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:40,160
But everybody, or there are certainly

969
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,760
10 to 20 classes of programmers.

970
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:48,760
And you do have to consider the one size doesn't fit all,

971
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,040
in most cases, in engineering.

972
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:55,160
That was what he became comfortable with over time.

973
00:53:55,160 --> 00:54:03,080
So he's giving you a technique to do what I said.

974
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:09,520
His sensibility and his ability to think, think out loud,

975
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:15,080
whatever, I think fits the model.

976
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:17,720
My brain and a number of the people

977
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:20,240
I found most successful on my team

978
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,960
did this incremental methodology.

979
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:31,040
One of the other things to be aware of,

980
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:35,440
which makes a difference, is where is this thing going

981
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,080
to run?

982
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:43,000
Because I will tell you, GPU tools,

983
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,400
they're getting better and better.

984
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:49,720
But they are not nearly as robust as CPU tools.

985
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,400
CPU has all these counters and everything else.

986
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,160
And if you go deep in the architecture,

987
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:59,240
there's 350 debug things that don't

988
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,240
impact the running of the code.

989
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,360
But they know how many caches happen,

990
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:06,840
and all this other stuff.

991
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:09,600
GPUs are just different animals.

992
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,200
It's not that it's bad or good.

993
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,840
It's how long they've been in the market, all this stuff.

994
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:19,280
So those things, the architecture makes a difference.

995
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:24,040
I'll talk about that a little bit in a second.

996
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,360
This is pretty standard stuff.

997
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:31,280
Just final, and I think Shazan kind of mentioned this

998
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,040
in passing, in a different way.

999
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,880
He goes, oh, just put your code out there.

1000
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,640
They'll look at it.

1001
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,800
I'm sure it compiles and everything.

1002
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:44,000
The reason he said that is because this part

1003
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,040
of the product process is non-trivial.

1004
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,400
You've done everything.

1005
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,560
Think perfectly, everything else.

1006
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,600
You get to the point where you want to give it

1007
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:01,360
to somebody in an easy-to-install manner,

1008
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:04,800
everything falls apart if you don't do that right.

1009
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:13,120
So there are jobs, extremely important jobs,

1010
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,720
in build, release, and deploy.

1011
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:18,760
People whose whole lives are being experts in that.

1012
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,400
So one, I don't want to discourage you

1013
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:22,840
from being experts in that.

1014
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,800
Actually, if you have this knowledge,

1015
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,000
if you have all this, you're more and more

1016
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,600
valuable to your company.

1017
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:35,680
But just keep this in mind as you go to the marketplace.

1018
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,560
We want to do cool eyeball.

1019
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:43,880
I mean, I will, complete honesty, horrible at this,

1020
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,480
me, personally.

1021
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,920
I just didn't want to do it.

1022
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,880
Hire somebody else to do that, whatever.

1023
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:55,920
It wasn't, I just couldn't get that sensibility.

1024
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:01,200
So I put these people on a pedestal.

1025
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,200
So just consider that.

1026
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,400
It's not some mundane thing.

1027
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,800
They are really making sure that the product

1028
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:15,200
quality in the customer's hands, that that first experience

1029
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,480
of using your code isn't horrible,

1030
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:21,960
because 95% of the time, there won't be a second experience.

1031
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,520
So just keep that in mind.

1032
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:28,360
Otherwise, think about test-driven development,

1033
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,680
this whole concept of you get quality

1034
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,040
to build it in incrementally.

1035
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:37,560
Fidelity.

1036
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:42,280
Fidelity means two things to me, particularly

1037
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,360
with a group like this.

1038
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,680
Typically, fidelity means image fidelity.

1039
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:54,440
It means, and we use it fairly regularly in ray tracing.

1040
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:59,440
If you either have a photograph or the ideal image

1041
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,400
that you sat around and generated

1042
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:06,080
with the world's simplest but most perfect ray

1043
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:10,440
tracer over 100 hours, if you're now

1044
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:15,160
going to do it in 1 30th of a second or 1 60th of a second,

1045
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,080
what's the fidelity?

1046
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:19,360
What's at first ground true?

1047
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,880
That's really important.

1048
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,200
It's very important when there's techniques

1049
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:27,240
involved that involve AI.

1050
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:32,200
They're inserting pixels in based on some neural network

1051
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:36,160
that may or may not be good, may or may not

1052
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,680
be good in a circumstance, that kind of thing.

1053
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:41,440
How many edge cases can it deal with?

1054
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,440
And obviously, any kind of antialiasing,

1055
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,800
even with rasterization and things like that.

1056
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:50,080
So that's a kind of fidelity.

1057
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,600
Did somebody have to say something?

1058
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:53,040
OK.

1059
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,200
The other fidelity you find in compute

1060
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:59,840
is mathematical fidelity, is precision.

1061
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,680
What is the right precision for the job you're doing?

1062
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:06,400
Because the lower the precision, the higher the performance.

1063
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,960
But it's kind of a quality metric, but it's not.

1064
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,600
You can have a precision bug and have instructions

1065
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,480
run perfectly.

1066
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:23,400
So just be aware of your result accuracy for the end user.

1067
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:26,440
In high-performance computing, I will tell you

1068
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:30,280
that for physics simulations, the stuff I was showing you,

1069
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:34,040
the NASA, everything else, the minimum

1070
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:40,360
is FP64 or 64-bit floating point.

1071
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:45,320
Most people have, there was a mode back in the day

1072
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:50,080
in Intel chips that was 80-bits.

1073
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:52,560
Most people can survive.

1074
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:57,600
It's really this difference between FP32 and FP64

1075
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:59,880
where things leap around.

1076
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:06,520
Most graphics devices are FP32 and perfectly fine.

1077
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:12,160
But year after year for our libraries,

1078
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:16,280
we've always got a company say, when

1079
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,880
am I going to be able to flick on double precision?

1080
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:23,560
And it turns out, in that whole quality and workflow

1081
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:26,560
and everything, it's not just flicking a bit.

1082
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:29,480
You've got to do all sorts of stuff to do it.

1083
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:31,200
So be aware.

1084
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,480
And then, of course, you see many more low-precision

1085
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,200
methodologies out there, particularly

1086
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,760
in machine learning.

1087
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,680
They're fantastic.

1088
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:43,920
This is twice as fast as this, twice as fast.

1089
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,840
This is a little bit faster.

1090
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:50,440
And FP16 is a little bit more precision.

1091
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,280
It depends on the use case.

1092
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:55,120
But just be aware that mathematical precision

1093
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:58,680
in computers is something you will encounter in your career,

1094
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:03,520
especially if you do software engineering and GPU programming.

1095
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:05,360
And in that case, think in advance

1096
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:08,960
how you're going to go back to the quality part.

1097
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,640
While fidelity is not quite the same,

1098
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,360
you need to think about how are you

1099
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:18,680
going to validate whether our situation works.

1100
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:26,960
And then performance, this is where the magic happens.

1101
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:33,080
And it's also where your product wins or loses in the marketplace.

1102
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:36,960
So it's great to have a brilliant algorithm.

1103
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:41,120
It's great to have a really cool idea.

1104
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:48,880
As soon as you put that idea out in open source or whatever form,

1105
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,280
you write a paper about it or whatever,

1106
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:55,840
someone's going to help you, particularly

1107
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:59,040
if you didn't really think about performance

1108
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,920
and the platform it's going to run on.

1109
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:07,800
And in some cases, again, harkening back to my Intel,

1110
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,800
we ran on every platform on the planet.

1111
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,000
We ran on supercomputers.

1112
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,760
The only thing we didn't really run on were these guys.

1113
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:21,880
Anything that had more than passing compute capability,

1114
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:26,200
we had to handle the precision, the quality, the performance,

1115
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:29,160
and maximize the performance on those.

1116
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:34,000
So again, be aware of these various things.

1117
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,840
This is where you delve into computer architecture

1118
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:39,800
a little bit.

1119
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:42,400
And it's not absolutely necessary,

1120
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,880
but if you're a GPU programming class,

1121
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:48,600
you have to have a sense of that architecture.

1122
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:49,280
What's a thread?

1123
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:50,000
What's a warp?

1124
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,200
What's a vector?

1125
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,480
How many vectors am I using?

1126
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,120
Is it in ray tracing?

1127
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:54,920
Is it coherent?

1128
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:57,000
Is it incoherent?

1129
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,680
How's the data go together?

1130
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,240
It all will impact it.

1131
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,320
So I'm not going to beat this up,

1132
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:10,480
but within six months on any job you take,

1133
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:14,920
particularly if you expose yourself as a GPU performance

1134
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:20,000
programmer, you will have to unassemble the code

1135
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,760
and look at the instructions and figure out what's going on.

1136
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:29,600
And something to realize, compilers, debuggers,

1137
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,120
they're software too.

1138
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:35,000
And despite everything I said about quality,

1139
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,080
I never said that I have this structure

1140
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:41,840
that I would lead the team with, but I never

1141
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:45,440
said our stuff didn't have any bugs.

1142
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:50,680
So just be aware that compilers and debuggers are software too.

1143
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:56,880
And they themselves, you sometimes

1144
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:00,320
have to rule out that the compiler generated bad code.

1145
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,640
Doesn't happen super often.

1146
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:04,440
It depends on a lot of factors.

1147
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:09,120
But in particular, with a new, so hey,

1148
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,920
I joined NVIDIA this week, and they're

1149
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:15,160
all excited about the 4090 RTXs and everything.

1150
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:16,600
That thing's new.

1151
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,400
Got a new core architecture called Hopper.

1152
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,440
It may be fantastic.

1153
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:25,880
They may have not a single bug in their CUDA compiler,

1154
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:28,560
but I'd be surprised if they didn't.

1155
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:31,960
So I'm not saying it's the first thing you do.

1156
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:34,920
It tends to be the last thing you do.

1157
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:39,400
But don't forget that the compiler can do bad things,

1158
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:43,040
or the compiler can be blocking you from performance.

1159
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:46,640
And sometimes, and this is really what comes out,

1160
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:50,320
know enough about this stuff.

1161
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:54,960
Read what you can.

1162
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:59,960
Play around and use debuggers to look at the code.

1163
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:03,280
Enough to say, do I understand these instructions enough

1164
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:12,800
to know that this calculation, I add two floating point numbers,

1165
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:15,120
that if you think about it, are vectors.

1166
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:19,280
So you're actually adding 64 numbers to 64 numbers,

1167
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:23,840
whatever it is, or eight, what have you.

1168
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:26,320
If that thing generated what's called scalar instructions,

1169
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,840
which is just an add, whatever, and not a vector add,

1170
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:31,520
or whatever, you go like, why the heck did it do that?

1171
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:34,200
And you may be able to rewrite your code,

1172
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:37,280
or look into it so the compiler catches that.

1173
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,960
And that's actually a very typical thing for performance.

1174
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:43,640
You actually don't write an assembly.

1175
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:46,600
You can go into what's called intrinsics or assembly

1176
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:49,040
language, that's last resort.

1177
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:52,560
Understand the compiler enough to do it.

1178
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:55,440
And if you can't do that, submit a bug report.

1179
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,520
So that's performance.

1180
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:02,160
It's really about the architecture

1181
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,240
and mapping your data to the cache hierarchies

1182
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:06,240
and all those things.

1183
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:11,960
And GPUs and CPUs are very different in that area.

1184
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:15,960
And then finally, that's not the end of performance.

1185
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:24,040
This gentleman over there with the pen or the pixel

1186
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:28,160
marker asked me about, oh, that thing

1187
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,160
wasn't on one computer.

1188
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:30,840
It was on multiple computers.

1189
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:35,600
Yes, but very often, you attempt to run on multiple computers,

1190
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:38,480
and it runs slower than one computer.

1191
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:41,560
So distributed performance is the next thing.

1192
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:44,440
It's a thing you're likely to encounter.

1193
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:46,400
The more stuff goes in the cloud,

1194
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,560
the more stuff that goes in the data center,

1195
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:51,000
the more stuff that is a combination of edge and data

1196
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,360
center, all that interaction and the data

1197
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:57,000
structures and the methodology bring a whole new layer

1198
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,360
of challenges in there.

1199
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:02,680
So just be aware of performance of multiple platforms.

1200
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:06,480
If you're not aware, the connectivity

1201
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,600
that you'll most encounter, pretty obvious,

1202
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:09,560
internet connectivity.

1203
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:11,680
You guys probably deal with that all the time,

1204
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,840
remote logins and stuff like that,

1205
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:18,400
or attempting to have multiple disparate computers.

1206
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:22,920
Ethernet locally sometimes is the other one.

1207
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:25,080
And then in high-performance computing,

1208
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:28,720
it's so important that they build their own networking

1209
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,280
products.

1210
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:32,480
NVIDIA owns a company called Melanos, which

1211
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:35,000
is one of the leaders in this.

1212
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,920
And this is operating, heading towards speed of light,

1213
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:43,560
maybe 1 10th to 1 5th, the memory speeds.

1214
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:48,000
But it can be the bottleneck.

1215
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:49,920
It also is very, very high speed.

1216
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,360
So just be aware that there are tools that

1217
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,360
do this and everything.

1218
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:56,480
But there's this new level of complexity beyond that.

1219
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:57,800
So there's this multi-tier.

1220
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:06,120
But just a key takeaway from all these aspects are,

1221
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:08,120
I didn't mention it too much, but obviously,

1222
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:12,320
your algorithm implementation is most likely

1223
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:15,760
will be the place where you find the low-hanging fruit

1224
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,120
in performance.

1225
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:19,320
You can get pretty far with that.

1226
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:23,880
Then consider the, I say XPU, I mean CPU, GPU,

1227
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,520
any compute device.

1228
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:29,560
Think about the architecture that you're mapping to.

1229
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:33,720
And then number three, when you encounter it,

1230
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:36,920
if you're at a company that's involved

1231
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,800
in high-performance computing or cloud computing,

1232
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:43,400
like at Google, then you might get involved in computing.

1233
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,840
So just keep that in mind.

1234
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:47,400
We'll stop for a minute and a break.

1235
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,560
I see people going like this, which is fine.

1236
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,200
I know it's the evening.

1237
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:55,360
And this isn't as exciting a topic

1238
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:57,560
as all the questions you have.

1239
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:01,280
No, I just wanted to thank you for telling us

1240
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:03,840
all about quality, fidelity, performance,

1241
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:05,280
and open source device.

1242
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:09,040
Melody is still also in engineering for a company.

1243
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,080
I had an interview with DreamWorks.

1244
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:12,640
And I asked them this question, why

1245
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:15,040
did you make Moonway open source?

1246
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:18,880
And then they bounced the question back to me.

1247
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:21,280
And although I had points, now I have more.

1248
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:22,600
So it's a thumbs up.

1249
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,560
And usually, whenever we are interviewing,

1250
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:28,240
and then we say that, oh, I have more experience,

1251
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:32,840
and I would like to go for a higher experience job,

1252
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:36,240
then there's this noun called bar rate.

1253
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:38,360
And quality, fidelity, performance,

1254
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:43,880
if we actually know about this, then we can name that.

1255
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:44,720
Thank you so much.

1256
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:46,680
I look forward.

1257
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:15,440
Thank you.

1258
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:45,440
Thank you.

1259
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,440
Thank you.

1260
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,440
Thank you.

1261
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:15,440
Thank you.

1262
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:48,040
I moved through my career and jumped to various places,

1263
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:51,680
or jumped at the things I was offered sometimes.

1264
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:53,720
The high performance computing thing actually

1265
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:55,240
completely came out of left field.

1266
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:02,560
Somebody made a bet on me, which is nice.

1267
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:06,760
They said, we want to hire you.

1268
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:08,920
Here's another twist, which I'll go into.

1269
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:12,120
A big company like Intel, NVIDIA, and everything,

1270
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,160
AMD, all those great companies.

1271
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,920
From a business standpoint, the hardest thing

1272
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:24,720
for a manager at these companies is to get one hit.

1273
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:31,880
Believe it or not, you have 5,500 people working

1274
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,600
on the hopper thing.

1275
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:34,840
You can just take one more.

1276
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:39,480
The reverse of that is, once they get it,

1277
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:43,440
they want to place the person right away.

1278
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:46,120
There's this mix of things.

1279
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:48,320
So just be aware of that.

1280
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:51,040
If you have a legitimate job interview, everything else,

1281
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:54,080
you're going through the process.

1282
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,880
It's a real quick fix.

1283
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:58,880
It's a real quick fix, and it's a real quick fix.

1284
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:01,680
And it's a real quick fix, and it's a real quick fix.

1285
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,080
It's a real quid pro quo.

1286
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,320
I'll talk about that in a second.

1287
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:11,720
But the bottom line is, it's fun and rewarding.

1288
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:14,520
That's why we do it.

1289
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:17,760
It has become, congratulations, different

1290
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:19,320
when I entered the marketplace.

1291
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:23,440
It was actually semi-unusual.

1292
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:26,200
Or it wasn't such a huge thing.

1293
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,080
Engineers were important, everything else.

1294
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,840
Software and computers were just a part of it.

1295
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:35,920
Computers were useful, important,

1296
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:39,440
but not like it is today.

1297
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,320
As much as I just said getting one headcount

1298
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:42,960
is hard and everything, particularly

1299
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:47,160
in the constrained environment we have right now,

1300
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:49,080
you're still desperately needed.

1301
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:50,160
You'll all get jobs.

1302
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,240
And that's because it is critical to solve

1303
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:58,160
these problems.

1304
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:02,440
We can't throw enough people at these problems.

1305
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:07,480
If engineering is your career goal,

1306
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:11,520
just be aware of this quality, fidelity, and performance.

1307
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:14,840
Your user base could be five world-class climate

1308
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:15,480
scientists.

1309
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:17,040
That's it.

1310
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,320
They're the only people you're trying to satisfy,

1311
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:23,120
or their peers or whatever.

1312
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:26,960
But they're trying to save the planet.

1313
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:31,280
If you give false information, bad fidelity, whatever,

1314
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,240
they're counting on you.

1315
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:35,400
They're counting on you guys to do it right.

1316
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,160
They're not going to assume you're wrong.

1317
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:47,160
So a targeted thing could be as critical as something

1318
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,600
that a million people are going to see.

1319
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:50,880
A game.

1320
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,360
And nothing's wrong with games.

1321
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:54,400
They make us feel better.

1322
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,120
They make us have fun.

1323
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:57,720
It's important to have fun, by the way.

1324
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:00,160
I'm not going to talk a lot about fun.

1325
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:02,080
It's fun.

1326
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:06,040
Make sure you're having fun wherever you go.

1327
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:11,160
If there's not an element of fun in it, get the hell out.

1328
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:13,880
Make sure that you're having some form of fun,

1329
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:17,560
and make sure you have a life.

1330
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:20,320
Seriously.

1331
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:22,520
If your manager doesn't let you have a life,

1332
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:25,680
that's the wrong manager.

1333
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:29,000
So you can change the world with software.

1334
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,920
OK, now, how much time do I have?

1335
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:33,840
I'm going.

1336
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:38,360
I mean, the class time is long, but you can take your time.

1337
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,960
OK, I talk a lot.

1338
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:43,280
I'm known for talking a lot, even though I try to tell you

1339
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:44,960
to boil things down.

1340
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:49,240
I'm going to talk now about the three major companies

1341
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:51,800
and their software requirements.

1342
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:54,080
So note this.

1343
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:56,840
I am not saying one is better than the other

1344
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:59,520
or representing them right now.

1345
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:07,520
What I call the incumbents, they're obviously,

1346
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,800
you have Imagination Technologies, a bunch of other.

1347
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:13,760
Obviously, with the metaverse, and you've

1348
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:16,480
got companies like Cesium, great companies like that.

1349
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:18,560
There's all sorts of cool stuff going on.

1350
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:22,440
But from my purview where I am, the distributors

1351
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:26,560
most of the computing technology are NVIDIA, Intel, and AMD.

1352
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:30,600
And then we can argue how Mac fits in there.

1353
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:35,320
As you see, I'm a Mac user, so they're in there as well.

1354
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:40,520
But let's just talk about these as GPU and CPU development

1355
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:42,360
environments.

1356
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:48,640
OK, so NVIDIA, I didn't pick them first for any reason

1357
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:52,400
other than it was how fast I could type.

1358
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:56,360
CUDA stands for Compute Unified Device Architecture.

1359
01:17:56,360 --> 01:18:01,000
I call that their direct GPU programming layer.

1360
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,120
They have this newer thing that came out.

1361
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:09,320
I'm in the Omniverse group, although I haven't figured out

1362
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:12,040
why I'm in the Omniverse group, but I'm in the Omniverse group.

1363
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:19,240
And that's a software platform for workflows, data

1364
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:21,480
interchange.

1365
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:24,560
In the parlance at various companies,

1366
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:27,960
this would be called a solution, where

1367
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:36,000
you apply software, hardware platforms to one or more

1368
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,480
capabilities or solutions.

1369
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:41,600
I'm not going to delve much into Omniverse.

1370
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:46,720
These are kind of the things that are happening.

1371
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:51,440
But Omniverse is more of a workflow

1372
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:55,840
that supports both developers and end-user workflows.

1373
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:58,040
It's pretty cool.

1374
01:18:58,040 --> 01:18:58,540
Yeah?

1375
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:00,440
AUDIENCE MEMBER 2 We have Rev coming to talk on the forum.

1376
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:01,000
Oh, you do?

1377
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:01,500
OK.

1378
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:02,880
Rev is not my boss.

1379
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:06,240
He's my boss's boss.

1380
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:09,080
So don't tell him I said anything bad.

1381
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:15,240
So Intel.

1382
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:18,760
I know a fair amount about this, what it is,

1383
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:21,240
but I've up-leveled it.

1384
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:27,880
So Intel's CUDA, and they would hate that I just said that,

1385
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:33,280
but the programming environment and concept

1386
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:37,360
is called SYCL, which is the Chrono Standard.

1387
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:40,640
You also will hear the term DPC++,

1388
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,840
which stands for Data Parallel C++.

1389
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:48,280
That is Intel's product implementation

1390
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:51,800
of the SYCL code.

1391
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:54,280
Incorporate SYCL, adds extensions,

1392
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:56,680
all that kind of stuff.

1393
01:19:56,680 --> 01:20:00,960
The whole concept is architecture agnostic direct

1394
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:03,640
programming.

1395
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:10,200
So will SYCL and oneAPI solve the problem you said?

1396
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:10,880
I don't know.

1397
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:15,600
You guys will have to pursue that.

1398
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:18,000
That's what Intel is pursuing.

1399
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,080
I'll talk about why they're pursuing it in a second.

1400
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:26,160
The other thing, when you hear oneAPI,

1401
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:27,520
everybody has heard of oneAPI?

1402
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:34,480
Sometimes those two things are used interchangeably.

1403
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:37,600
This is where I can actually tell you, and it's not insider,

1404
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,520
it's just confusing.

1405
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:42,080
This is the closest thing.

1406
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:46,080
It's a compilation environment, CUDA's compilation environment.

1407
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:50,680
Let's you write a piece of code that runs on a part,

1408
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:52,680
runs on a processor.

1409
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:54,760
oneAPI is two things.

1410
01:20:54,760 --> 01:21:01,240
oneAPI is an open industry specification led by Intel,

1411
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:04,800
but they have, in a Chronos-like manner,

1412
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,120
gathered a bunch of people.

1413
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:13,040
And they are truly trying to make it vendor agnostic,

1414
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:17,520
open source, single source code environment

1415
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:18,640
that runs everywhere.

1416
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:20,640
That's their goal.

1417
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:24,520
And then B is anywhere you see Intel

1418
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:27,800
registered trademark oneAPI, that's

1419
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:30,440
the equivalent of data parallel C++ in the case.

1420
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:33,680
This is the embodiment in an Intel,

1421
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:37,600
they often call it a toolkit or SDK.

1422
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:42,600
That is Intel's version that, for sure,

1423
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:48,880
has been tested, hopefully well, with Intel hardware components.

1424
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:52,080
They'll come out first on Intel hardware components, usually.

1425
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:56,680
There's one case on my team where it went the other way.

1426
01:21:56,680 --> 01:21:58,720
But potentially other vendors.

1427
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:00,640
How that potentially other vendors happen

1428
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:02,560
is a whole mix of things.

1429
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:06,360
From the community, there's community folks doing it.

1430
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:08,200
Intel just bought a company that was

1431
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:11,880
supposed to be a community company that Intel bought from.

1432
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:14,880
Nothing's wrong with that, either way.

1433
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:20,880
But the Uber goal is, from an Intel perspective,

1434
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:25,320
is one source code runs everywhere.

1435
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:31,160
And then AMD has HIP, Heterogeneous Interface

1436
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:32,440
for Portability.

1437
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:37,200
That's their direct GPU programming layer.

1438
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:42,800
As best as I can tell, because I haven't been at AMD,

1439
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:49,240
it is a very CUDA-like method where you can go do HIP, CUDA.

1440
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:51,280
There's probably translators, all sorts of stuff.

1441
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:56,280
There's actually a conversion tool

1442
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:59,520
that SYCL has from CUDA, as well.

1443
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,000
And that's an interesting dynamic,

1444
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,440
which I'll talk about in a second.

1445
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:03,600
Anyway, you have HIP.

1446
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:11,280
And then you have ROCM, which is the one API-ish-like thing

1447
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:12,520
that's not really one API.

1448
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:13,760
So it's different.

1449
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:16,760
But the concept is the open platform.

1450
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:20,280
So what you see happening is AMD and Intel

1451
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:24,960
are heavily leaning to what they call open.

1452
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:29,440
And I'll talk about NVIDIA in a second,

1453
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:32,320
because it doesn't mean that NVIDIA is not open.

1454
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:34,120
But that is the position.

1455
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:37,280
The positioning of these guys is open.

1456
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:41,720
At the same time, AMD is trying to carve its own path.

1457
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:43,800
And we'll see how that all goes.

1458
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:46,800
And that's what I mean by this isn't

1459
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:49,920
going to be solved this year.

1460
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:52,360
And as you guys get out there, you're

1461
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:55,960
going to hopefully help figure out

1462
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:57,400
what the right thing to do is.

1463
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:01,360
And it's confusing.

1464
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:06,000
And there's economics involved, and products,

1465
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,480
and everything else.

1466
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:11,160
But conceptually, that's what it is.

1467
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:14,240
OK, so this is from an NVIDIA, I'm

1468
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:16,280
calling it an outside-in viewpoint,

1469
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:18,440
from a public technologist who's

1470
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:25,280
looking at NVIDIA's concept, and what they're doing,

1471
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,720
and why they're doing what they're doing,

1472
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:33,520
is the CUDA is compute unified device architecture.

1473
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:36,840
The key to understand from an NVIDIA standpoint

1474
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:37,920
is the unified.

1475
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:43,720
This is James Rinder's calling.

1476
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:46,120
He is the co-author on the books I wrote.

1477
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:49,640
But I won't answer James.

1478
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:54,560
I'll call him later and tell him I was talking to you guys.

1479
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:59,240
He also is the primary evangelist for OneAPI.

1480
01:24:59,240 --> 01:24:59,920
Still a friend.

1481
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:06,920
The key to understand the unified,

1482
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:09,040
and where NVIDIA is coming from with CUDA,

1483
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:12,480
and why they don't, in my mind, and again, this

1484
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:15,520
is not an insider, this is an outsider view,

1485
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:18,320
why they don't even, they rarely address it.

1486
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:19,600
They don't talk about OneAPI.

1487
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:20,680
They don't talk about him.

1488
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:22,600
They don't talk about any of that stuff.

1489
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:27,240
They don't really try to position themselves that way.

1490
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:31,480
The fundamental thing is the compilers, and the software,

1491
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:34,040
and the interfaces, and everything

1492
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:37,840
are what's called co-designed with the hardware.

1493
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,880
Performance.

1494
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:47,560
Quality and performance is what's in their mind together.

1495
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:50,560
So you go back to the thing I said.

1496
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:53,320
Fidelity is kind of in there too,

1497
01:25:53,320 --> 01:26:00,240
but that's a little bit of a performance-first viewpoint

1498
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:03,520
for the market.

1499
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:11,400
It is serving them in that if they have the best, or easiest,

1500
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:14,520
or most performing development environment,

1501
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:19,520
then people like you guys say, I got to buy an NVIDIA device

1502
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:22,320
because I get my things done with that.

1503
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:23,360
Nothing's wrong with that.

1504
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:27,240
That's market marketing.

1505
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:29,080
Others call it proprietary because it only

1506
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:30,960
runs on NVIDIA hardware.

1507
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:32,960
Others call it proprietary because it only

1508
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:35,680
runs on NVIDIA, but it only runs on NVIDIA by design

1509
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:39,920
because the software teams and the hardware teams

1510
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:42,600
sit down together and do it.

1511
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:51,440
Intel, AMD aspire to do that, but it's not clear to me.

1512
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:54,000
And it's there.

1513
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,280
It's discussed on both companies.

1514
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:58,520
I'm not telling you anything inside.

1515
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:02,240
But their emphasis, all the way from the CEO, Jensen,

1516
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:05,280
is the unified design delivers the best

1517
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:08,120
combination of quality and performance to the marketplace,

1518
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:13,800
and that's what you're going to deliver to change the world.

1519
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:19,480
So is it proprietary?

1520
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:22,080
At the same time, it's complex.

1521
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:25,880
So we go back to, we might have a really crazy work

1522
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:27,800
in there because the hardware does this, that,

1523
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:32,080
and they don't want to expose it.

1524
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:35,760
They do better with the marketplace that they don't.

1525
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:38,800
So these are all challenges, decisions

1526
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:44,120
that are legitimate market and customer-based decisions.

1527
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:50,400
So while competitors call it proprietary,

1528
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:53,160
it appears to me it's about quality and performance

1529
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:54,720
and the notion of co-design.

1530
01:27:54,720 --> 01:28:00,920
By the way, everybody, who's heard of exascale?

1531
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:02,600
You know what exascale means?

1532
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:04,240
Anybody?

1533
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:10,200
So exascale is the eras of supercomputing

1534
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:17,160
are based on how many floating, double precision,

1535
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:18,040
remember I mentioned?

1536
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:22,920
Double precision floating point calculations.

1537
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:30,760
The top 5 to 10 supercomputers and some of the waterfalls.

1538
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:32,360
So we are transitioning from what's

1539
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:34,960
called the petascale era.

1540
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:41,840
So if you know what a petabyte is, petascale means,

1541
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:42,400
what is that?

1542
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:50,000
A terascale is a trillion floating point ops,

1543
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:54,400
and then you have peta, which is the next power of 3,

1544
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,200
add power of 3.

1545
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:58,120
Exascale is the next power of 3.

1546
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:05,480
It's a quadrillion floating point operations per second,

1547
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:08,600
and a machine that's an exascale machine does that.

1548
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:14,080
Why did I bring up exascale?

1549
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:27,320
Is the concept of exascale is to get these computers delivering

1550
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:30,760
that capability, and to some extent,

1551
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:32,680
each one of these computers, while it

1552
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:35,440
uses tons of open source software, everything else,

1553
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:39,240
they are a targeted architecture with those interconnects,

1554
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:40,520
everything else.

1555
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:43,680
So in a weird way, as long as the tools exist,

1556
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:48,920
like CUDA, they're going to go for performance.

1557
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:55,880
The other point is I joined the industry just about 12,

1558
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:59,880
14 years ago, and they said we will only

1559
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:05,040
get to exascale if we co-design with AMD, Nvidia,

1560
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:07,000
a broader level of co-design.

1561
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:11,000
But the concept of co-design software and hardware

1562
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:16,000
is not something invented or anything else.

1563
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,840
It is a known methodology that gets you where you want to go.

1564
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:21,400
So that's where Nvidia is coming from.

1565
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:23,640
So a quick point on what you said earlier

1566
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:24,800
about it being proprietary.

1567
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,480
Probably the easiest example of it

1568
01:30:27,480 --> 01:30:31,400
is if you've ever seen your driver updates for Nvidia,

1569
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:33,880
and it has, ooh, Spider-Man came out.

1570
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:36,520
We have an optimization for Spider-Man.

1571
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:38,880
And whatever the new holiday game is going to come out,

1572
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:40,200
you guys know better than I do.

1573
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:42,560
They're going to have an optimization for that.

1574
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:45,480
And they can do it because it's proprietary.

1575
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:47,400
And the driver will sit in.

1576
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:52,320
So anyway, the bottom line is it's always two-sided.

1577
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:56,400
Be aware of that.

1578
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:57,400
OK, Intel.

1579
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:03,480
Intel wants to help you solve, I believe,

1580
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:06,560
the problem you talked to me about,

1581
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:10,160
Intel and a little bit of AMD.

1582
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:17,120
This comes from the concept that while all you

1583
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:21,160
guys are going to be valuable to your company,

1584
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:26,000
you're a cost sink for the most part.

1585
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,720
It depends on what company you're at.

1586
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:29,320
It's not necessarily true.

1587
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:31,680
You could come in and amplify the software sales

1588
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:34,000
with the stuff and everything.

1589
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,120
But you come in.

1590
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:39,000
You're a resource.

1591
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,680
Yes, you're delivering stuff.

1592
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:43,560
But they care about what's called ROI,

1593
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:44,680
return on investment.

1594
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:50,320
And you guys are an investment for myself.

1595
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:52,080
I'm a cost sink, too.

1596
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:58,880
So the whole point is if you have three GPU environments,

1597
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:03,360
like I just said, rule of thumb is

1598
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:08,520
it's three times as costly to support a market product.

1599
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:09,920
Now, you can pick and choose.

1600
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:11,440
You can pick two.

1601
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:13,080
You can support later.

1602
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:15,440
You dance around all this stuff.

1603
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:17,720
But the concept that Intel's going with

1604
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:20,560
is that's a big problem.

1605
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:23,040
No one's ever solved it.

1606
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:26,120
NVIDIA doesn't seem to want to solve it.

1607
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:29,400
But the marketplace is at, we believe the marketplace

1608
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:30,160
is asking for it.

1609
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:32,560
And in fact, they are.

1610
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:43,000
It's a way to be a good citizen in the marketplace

1611
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:46,480
as well as drive a preference for Intel

1612
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:50,960
because Intel is doing this and cares about the market

1613
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:53,040
and everything else.

1614
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:56,280
And on the other hand is to keep Intel in the market.

1615
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:58,320
It is competitive.

1616
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:02,960
Intel and NVIDIA, everybody has been impacted

1617
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:06,840
by the economics that have happened lately.

1618
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:09,800
But Intel's being impacted by AMD and other things.

1619
01:33:09,800 --> 01:33:12,080
So it's a competitive environment.

1620
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:17,960
It's intended to provide a market-worthy capability that

1621
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:21,560
says Intel thinks about customers first, which

1622
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:24,880
is not a bad thing.

1623
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:29,080
But their argument or the sub-argument

1624
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:33,000
to what they're doing is you'll have to write less code.

1625
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,560
And it goes back to the open source thing we talked about.

1626
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:39,400
More open source code will just work.

1627
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:44,040
It will work everywhere if you choose this paradigm.

1628
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:46,640
And so they're offering that up and driving it.

1629
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:51,640
And that's related.

1630
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:54,760
It's one code base to run everywhere.

1631
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:57,160
And the other twist, we talked about it a little bit,

1632
01:33:57,160 --> 01:34:00,160
is the CPUs are changing as well.

1633
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:02,280
Mac has their own CPUs.

1634
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:06,800
AMD is still IA, but trying to insert their special sauce

1635
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:07,840
in there.

1636
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:12,600
NVIDIA is coming out with a CPU, which I'm personally

1637
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:13,520
very excited about.

1638
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:15,640
It probably will be a big part of my job

1639
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:18,840
to make that thing go.

1640
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:21,040
But there's architecture twists.

1641
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:27,560
So now, not only are the GPUs three of them,

1642
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:30,160
there's three, four, or five CPU things.

1643
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:33,120
And now you have an infinite number

1644
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:35,240
of back ends you need and all that kind of stuff.

1645
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:39,560
Maybe not infinite, but 10s and 20s of them.

1646
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:42,880
So the bottom line is, that's the vision

1647
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:44,080
that Intel's going with.

1648
01:34:44,080 --> 01:34:46,320
It's a good vision.

1649
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:47,880
My concern, go ahead.

1650
01:34:47,880 --> 01:34:49,680
It's not bad when it does.

1651
01:34:49,680 --> 01:34:50,680
Why is it called SIGL?

1652
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:54,680
Is it stand for something?

1653
01:34:54,680 --> 01:35:00,480
The CL stands for OpenCL, because the original back end,

1654
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:03,720
the way they were going to get portability was through OpenCL.

1655
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:06,960
And I forget.

1656
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:11,080
So anyway, the CL stands for OpenCL, Compute Language.

1657
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:13,760
And then I don't know what the SY stands for.

1658
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:15,120
That's actually a good question.

1659
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:18,440
We should talk about that.

1660
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:20,480
I worked briefly with the back end workforce.

1661
01:35:20,480 --> 01:35:25,160
Yeah, it's not something that jumps out at you, but yeah.

1662
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:33,160
But its original form was a compiler

1663
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:40,160
that could target LLVM, OpenCL, and a bunch of other code

1664
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:47,560
generating back ends to target this one code base thing.

1665
01:35:47,560 --> 01:35:50,360
Intel's goal is to accelerate the adoption and all

1666
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:57,160
that kind of stuff, and going with that as a methodology.

1667
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:59,720
That's extensible.

1668
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:03,320
So one code base to run on all, rule of the law,

1669
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:06,920
hear the Lord of the Rings person like I am.

1670
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:10,560
But the whole idea is to reduce dev time and company software

1671
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:14,920
costs is the main argument.

1672
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:19,600
One code base, all that stuff I talked about, CI, everything.

1673
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:24,160
Technically, you should be able to pick one platform

1674
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:28,120
and test it all in it, assume it runs on other platforms.

1675
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:29,480
Obviously, I don't recommend that.

1676
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:31,680
You would run it everywhere.

1677
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:37,320
And then the perspective is, CUDA's been out there,

1678
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:40,120
I don't know, 15, 20 years, and has

1679
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:44,440
gone through a lot of the pains and ecosystem

1680
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:48,440
enabling and multiple generations of product

1681
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:50,920
and everything.

1682
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:54,640
And SYCL's about three to four years old.

1683
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:59,120
Or I'm sorry, one API and how it's utilized.

1684
01:36:59,120 --> 01:37:01,160
And so it's not completely there yet.

1685
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:03,680
It's not necessarily they won't go faster.

1686
01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:06,720
It might be ready in three years.

1687
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:09,400
And I'm not saying it's not ready necessarily now,

1688
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:12,280
but I do believe logic dictates that you'll

1689
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:16,320
run into more compiler problems, like I was saying,

1690
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:18,440
some performance problems.

1691
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:22,800
And performance portability will be,

1692
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:25,400
what we call performance portability,

1693
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:30,000
will be the potential knock on SYCL.

1694
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,320
OK, it runs everywhere, but it only runs really great on Intel

1695
01:37:33,320 --> 01:37:36,560
would be the thing to look out for.

1696
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:39,320
Intel will say, no, we want it to run great everywhere.

1697
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:44,760
But NVIDIA and AMD will probably have to join in and make it

1698
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:45,400
work.

1699
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:47,400
And now you have NVIDIA, am I going

1700
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:50,920
to invest in this thing when CUDA runs great

1701
01:37:50,920 --> 01:37:53,040
and all this stuff?

1702
01:37:53,040 --> 01:37:56,920
But that's the concept, an open standard, open market.

1703
01:37:56,920 --> 01:38:00,600
It's good if it's the whole notion of open source.

1704
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:04,200
You think of Intel, to an extent AMD is doubling down on that.

1705
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:10,560
I'll tell you, I haven't followed AMD a whole lot.

1706
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:15,120
They are a smaller player in CPUs and GPUs,

1707
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:17,040
but they're an aggressive player.

1708
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:19,640
And they've done a really great job the last five years.

1709
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:26,440
The advantages they have, I would call it the drafter

1710
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:29,080
advantage.

1711
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:33,720
They appear to focus on drafting off the others

1712
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:39,160
and having a good market and having good ROI and capabilities

1713
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:44,760
off of Intel and NVIDIA's considered necessary ecosystem

1714
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:46,520
investment.

1715
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:48,720
The ecosystem is getting open source,

1716
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:53,360
so AMD can kind of draft off of that stuff

1717
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:56,720
and also pick and choose certain markets

1718
01:38:56,720 --> 01:39:00,880
they can go into, avoid others, and target performance benefits

1719
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:01,600
for everything.

1720
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:03,880
Again, nothing wrong with that.

1721
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:06,360
It's a great business model.

1722
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:08,320
They're doing very well.

1723
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:13,480
And they are beating Intel and NVIDIA more often

1724
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:16,400
in the last five years than they have with this model.

1725
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:21,680
Lisa Souther has been their CEO through this

1726
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:23,120
and doing a really good job.

1727
01:39:23,120 --> 01:39:24,800
They have some very good business models.

1728
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:26,640
They have a lot of people in the management

1729
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:27,800
doing a really good job.

1730
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:30,040
They have some very exciting things.

1731
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:31,160
You know I took a new job.

1732
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:32,760
I did talk to AMD.

1733
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:38,800
And I wouldn't necessarily not join them for any reason.

1734
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:42,240
But I do view them as a little bit more of a drafter who

1735
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:46,000
does targeted innovation.

1736
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:50,240
And like I said, they're a strong competitor.

1737
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:54,280
They're steadily growing market share,

1738
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:56,640
which is what you want as a company.

1739
01:39:56,640 --> 01:39:57,800
They're growing market share.

1740
01:39:57,800 --> 01:39:59,960
They're not losing market share.

1741
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:01,840
And they're not just maintaining market share.

1742
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:04,160
So they are building up.

1743
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:07,560
And there's a thing called crossing the chasm.

1744
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:10,440
And they're heading towards that where

1745
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:15,560
they may be able to leap and suddenly become a leader.

1746
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:21,040
That's what an NVIDIA and an Intel need to look out for.

1747
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:24,880
I see that OneAPI and Rockham have similar goals.

1748
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:29,800
Again, AMD has the advantage of if they don't mess things up

1749
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:34,760
too much, OneAPI will run great on their parts anyway.

1750
01:40:34,760 --> 01:40:37,760
And Rockham can be something they spearhead

1751
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:39,080
into specific markets.

1752
01:40:40,040 --> 01:40:44,840
Real quick thoughts on pursuing a job.

1753
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:50,000
We already were talking a little bit about the interview.

1754
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,720
My perspective after all these years,

1755
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:55,600
when I was entering the market, I

1756
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:57,720
couldn't have given a crap about company culture.

1757
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:03,040
And it wasn't really that thing.

1758
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:06,040
I'm just telling you it's extremely important.

1759
01:41:06,040 --> 01:41:06,920
Keep that in mind.

1760
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:11,320
What does the company stand for?

1761
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:14,560
How do they operate between each other?

1762
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:22,600
Are they really invested in inclusion, which

1763
01:41:22,600 --> 01:41:24,040
most companies are these days?

1764
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:28,960
But you need to hear it from them.

1765
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,920
You need to understand that.

1766
01:41:30,920 --> 01:41:35,320
So don't diminish what a company culture means.

1767
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:40,120
Some companies, NVIDIA and Intel, write it down.

1768
01:41:40,120 --> 01:41:44,400
Some companies don't, but they have a sense of what it is.

1769
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:48,400
In the interview process, see if they volunteer

1770
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:51,000
what their culture is, which is great.

1771
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:55,280
If they don't, try to discern it through various ways,

1772
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:57,080
ultimately just saying, how would you

1773
01:41:57,080 --> 01:41:59,240
characterize the company culture?

1774
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:00,120
Just ask the question.

1775
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:14,520
Again, to me, you should be wary if they can't describe it.

1776
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:16,720
And of course, you want to do the classic.

1777
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:19,240
You're almost certainly going to interview with three to six

1778
01:42:19,240 --> 01:42:21,880
people, or in a team setting or whatever.

1779
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:24,520
Make sure three or four people say the same thing,

1780
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:26,520
or at least similar things.

1781
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:29,120
Then you know the company actually has a culture.

1782
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:35,000
If they're making it up as they go, it still might be OK.

1783
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,040
It might be nascent or whatever.

1784
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:44,200
But I found in my career, I'll be completely blunt with you.

1785
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:49,000
I joined NVIDIA, once I was talking to people,

1786
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:57,400
NVIDIA's culture, not the job, not the salary, not all that.

1787
01:42:57,400 --> 01:43:04,320
It was NVIDIA's culture, how the folks I spoke to,

1788
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:08,200
more senior people in my case, but they

1789
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:11,000
were adamant about what it meant.

1790
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,520
And they all corroborated everything.

1791
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:17,560
So it was important to me at this stage in my career.

1792
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:19,320
And I would say, when I was younger,

1793
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:23,280
I kind of ignored it until I went to a company

1794
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:25,640
with a heavy culture.

1795
01:43:25,640 --> 01:43:26,920
And I loved it.

1796
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:30,800
So think about that.

1797
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:33,360
Make sure they do have a mission and goal.

1798
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:35,040
Again, doesn't have to be written down.

1799
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:36,800
It is different than culture.

1800
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:40,400
Culture is, how do we operate as a company?

1801
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:41,200
What are we for?

1802
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:43,320
What do we stand for?

1803
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:49,240
And what is the team and organization?

1804
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:51,760
It's OK in a big company to have different cultures

1805
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:53,720
across organizations.

1806
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:55,480
Sometimes you have two layers of culture.

1807
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:56,200
That's all OK.

1808
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:58,200
Just make sure there's a culture you understand

1809
01:43:58,200 --> 01:43:59,720
what you're getting into.

1810
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:01,880
The mission statement has to be exciting.

1811
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:06,280
It has to be an objective that you align with,

1812
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:07,600
or it should be.

1813
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:13,720
Again, and they sometimes morph, but at least consider it.

1814
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:18,600
The other thing is, are you being

1815
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:23,440
hired to be a cog in the wheel?

1816
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:26,520
We have 75 tasks to get done this year.

1817
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:29,440
We know we're going to have 150 next.

1818
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:32,920
Go do all those tasks.

1819
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:39,360
Or is there a balance to, well, if I'm doing my task,

1820
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:42,960
what if I realize it's not the right thing to do?

1821
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:48,560
Or there's a better way to do it.

1822
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:51,680
That is the other side.

1823
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:53,840
Obviously, like a research organization,

1824
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:56,240
that's their whole goal, is to be creative and everything.

1825
01:44:56,240 --> 01:44:56,800
And that's OK.

1826
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:57,720
That's cool.

1827
01:44:57,720 --> 01:44:59,600
It's actually OK to be a cog in the wheel.

1828
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:02,000
It depends on you.

1829
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,320
It depends on where you are in your career.

1830
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:06,560
Just banging stuff out and getting out

1831
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:10,840
of the market and contributing can be very rewarding.

1832
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:12,440
So I'm not telling you it's bad.

1833
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:15,120
I'm just telling you be aware of what you're getting into.

1834
01:45:15,120 --> 01:45:18,720
And if your desire is to primarily move

1835
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:21,440
in this direction, think about it.

1836
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:22,400
That's all.

1837
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:25,080
However, there will be times you might want to come out

1838
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:27,680
and do this, or Jim says, that's great.

1839
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:29,560
I'm just telling you, being a cog in the wheel

1840
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:33,680
and delivering stuff, you can rise happily in a company

1841
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:34,520
if you do that.

1842
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:36,360
So that's good.

1843
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:38,120
And then this is very similar.

1844
01:45:38,120 --> 01:45:40,520
Are you interested in the company, the product, the team,

1845
01:45:40,520 --> 01:45:41,680
money?

1846
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:43,520
All those can be important at different times

1847
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:44,160
in your career.

1848
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:46,320
It is not bad to want the money.

1849
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:48,760
It is not bad.

1850
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:52,800
It just depends on where you are, what you do.

1851
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:57,280
I will just say it depends on your personal circumstances

1852
01:45:57,280 --> 01:46:01,480
and everything else, student loans up the wazoo, whatever

1853
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:02,600
you need the money.

1854
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:04,080
That's all cool.

1855
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:05,680
Just be aware that you consciously

1856
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:07,680
made the decision to go there.

1857
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:09,960
And then you may end up being cog in a wheel,

1858
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:13,640
and it may be great for that stage of your career.

1859
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:17,840
So this is not a one size fits all.

1860
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:20,960
And then the other thing I can't stress more than anything

1861
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:23,920
is tell the truth.

1862
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:26,280
Don't stretch it.

1863
01:46:26,280 --> 01:46:31,080
You'll be much more respected if they say,

1864
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:34,520
have you ever heard of Exascale?

1865
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:36,080
No.

1866
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:39,160
Just say it, right?

1867
01:46:39,160 --> 01:46:43,560
Or even better, no, but could you tell me what it is?

1868
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:45,920
Oh, oh, I heard of it in a different context, whatever.

1869
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:47,280
That's all the truth.

1870
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:49,960
But be yourself and be truthful.

1871
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:56,200
The last thing you want to do is go or have

1872
01:46:56,200 --> 01:47:01,160
a manager thinking something, and it

1873
01:47:01,160 --> 01:47:02,960
doesn't align with everybody.

1874
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:04,840
So it's pretty simple.

1875
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:08,320
And then the last one is, which you guys are doing an OK job,

1876
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:13,600
but not a great job today, ask questions.

1877
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:15,920
Actually, your questions are probably

1878
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:21,040
as important as your answers in a job interview situation.

1879
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:26,960
So again, you don't have to be a guru about the company.

1880
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:28,880
You don't have to go through every product they

1881
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:30,080
have and everything else.

1882
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:33,400
Learn enough about the company and listen closely

1883
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:38,040
to questions they're asking you, whatever,

1884
01:47:38,040 --> 01:47:41,440
and ask some intuitive questions.

1885
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:43,160
However, be truthful.

1886
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:47,840
If you are out of questions, don't make it up.

1887
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:48,340
OK?

1888
01:47:48,340 --> 01:47:48,960
That's good.

1889
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:52,080
So as I interview a lot for Cesium,

1890
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:56,120
I think the last two points on identify what you want to do

1891
01:47:56,120 --> 01:47:58,600
and then identify what you're in for,

1892
01:47:58,600 --> 01:48:00,880
you don't always have to be completely honest about it

1893
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:03,160
with me as an interviewer, but at least

1894
01:48:03,160 --> 01:48:05,160
be honest with yourself about what you're doing.

1895
01:48:05,160 --> 01:48:05,960
At a minimum, yeah.

1896
01:48:05,960 --> 01:48:07,520
So that's the main thing.

1897
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:10,320
The ask questions part, as I'm interviewing,

1898
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:13,280
I'm like, if and when I look for a job,

1899
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:16,640
I need three interviews just to ask my own questions.

1900
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:17,840
It's kind of like that.

1901
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:19,800
And if somebody comes into the interview

1902
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:22,600
and they ask one question, I'm like,

1903
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:25,000
are you really interested in this job?

1904
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,200
I would probably expect that.

1905
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:26,800
Exactly.

1906
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:28,680
And you can always go.

1907
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:35,000
You can be in the deepest, how many GPU programs

1908
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,200
have you written and whatever, and do you

1909
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:40,400
understand this part and everything?

1910
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:42,160
And then you answer them and everything,

1911
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:45,040
and then the person goes, well, I've done my questions.

1912
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:47,440
Ask them a culture question.

1913
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:50,120
Even though they're all technical the whole time,

1914
01:48:50,120 --> 01:48:53,240
you can ask a question or something

1915
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:54,740
that's on your mind, what they said.

1916
01:48:54,740 --> 01:48:57,960
You can completely change it because this person likely

1917
01:48:57,960 --> 01:49:01,880
is going to be sitting next to you in three weeks coding

1918
01:49:01,880 --> 01:49:04,240
and designing and doing stuff that's important.

1919
01:49:04,240 --> 01:49:09,640
So make sure you ask those questions.

1920
01:49:09,640 --> 01:49:11,080
Jim does have a question.

1921
01:49:11,080 --> 01:49:12,480
Yes.

1922
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:16,400
I go to you when you're asking a question.

1923
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:19,840
Not just for the sake of it, but you

1924
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:21,840
mentioned that we should, of course,

1925
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:24,880
find out about the company that we are interested in.

1926
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:29,040
And would you, or also, do you suggest

1927
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:32,080
that we should be prepared of things

1928
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:34,920
that we should specifically know before trying to draw,

1929
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:36,320
especially role-specific?

1930
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:37,920
Because I've also realized that you

1931
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:40,720
might know about the company, but the team

1932
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:43,920
or specific role that you're interviewing for,

1933
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:45,440
it's not necessarily the same.

1934
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:47,520
Like you said, in the culture, it

1935
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:49,640
was within the company.

1936
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:51,560
How do you, do you have a session?

1937
01:49:51,560 --> 01:49:53,240
How do you find out about these things?

1938
01:49:53,240 --> 01:50:00,120
Apart from directly doing the interview, before that, maybe?

1939
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:05,160
There is a really, the bottom line,

1940
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:08,320
I'm going to throw it, what I said right back to you.

1941
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:10,880
Ask questions about what the job and the role was.

1942
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:14,600
Throw email or the recruiter.

1943
01:50:14,600 --> 01:50:17,280
Interestingly, depends on how big the company is.

1944
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:20,040
I mean, the recruiter probably has no clue.

1945
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:22,360
And at Intel, the recruiter wouldn't even

1946
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:23,760
know how to answer your question.

1947
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:28,520
So they'll put it to the hiring manager or someone like that.

1948
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:36,920
And one, it's OK that you don't know.

1949
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:38,040
It's a failure.

1950
01:50:38,040 --> 01:50:42,840
It's a potential gap, not failure, gap

1951
01:50:42,840 --> 01:50:46,680
in how the job was presented to you.

1952
01:50:46,680 --> 01:50:48,680
That's a gap on the company side,

1953
01:50:48,680 --> 01:50:51,880
which actually doesn't look good for the company.

1954
01:50:51,880 --> 01:50:56,840
So if you're, obviously, every last thing,

1955
01:50:56,840 --> 01:51:00,880
am I going to write a program with I++ in it?

1956
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:02,120
That's different.

1957
01:51:02,120 --> 01:51:09,440
But a software engineering role in a networking organization

1958
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:13,640
with the goal of optimizing X, Y, Z,

1959
01:51:13,640 --> 01:51:16,640
that should be somewhat clear.

1960
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:22,640
If they left a gap there, ask them before you go in.

1961
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:25,040
Yeah, and one thing I always recommend,

1962
01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:27,640
especially if you guys come up to me and talk to me and say,

1963
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:28,920
I have an interview coming up.

1964
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:30,080
Do you have tips?

1965
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:31,800
The first thing I'm going to ask is,

1966
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:33,600
do you know who you're interviewing with

1967
01:51:33,600 --> 01:51:35,280
and what their role is?

1968
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,760
And if you don't know, you better email the HR

1969
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:41,960
when they ask you what time slots are you available at.

1970
01:51:41,960 --> 01:51:45,080
Ask them who you're interviewing with and what they do.

1971
01:51:45,080 --> 01:51:46,800
The Google machine.

1972
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:49,480
And then you can do whatever Google search you want.

1973
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:50,840
Exactly, exactly.

1974
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:55,600
Use the Google machine, the Google button, or whatever.

1975
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:58,080
LinkedIn, all that stuff.

1976
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:04,120
But yeah, basically, gap in knowledge, ask.

1977
01:52:04,120 --> 01:52:07,800
And in fact, it's pretty much what

1978
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:14,680
I say once you're on the job, right?

1979
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:17,320
Don't, it is OK.

1980
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:19,720
You are new.

1981
01:52:19,720 --> 01:52:22,760
They could have done a great job of telling you what the job is.

1982
01:52:22,760 --> 01:52:24,520
You still don't know what it is.

1983
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:28,160
You don't know what it is, and it could change in three months

1984
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:31,560
because of industry movement, whatever.

1985
01:52:31,560 --> 01:52:34,680
That's why you need to consider the culture and everything

1986
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:36,200
else.

1987
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:39,760
By the time you land in the job, the job you interviewed

1988
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:41,440
might be gone.

1989
01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:46,880
In fact, I'd say it's 33% to 50% chance these days

1990
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:48,600
that that's actually likely.

1991
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:59,080
If you're here and you're graduating in May or whatever,

1992
01:52:59,080 --> 01:53:02,600
you actually might get hired in January, February, whatever.

1993
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:04,040
Could go longer, but what have you.

1994
01:53:04,040 --> 01:53:10,120
But if there's a gap of more than three months,

1995
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:12,600
you might have a different manager.

1996
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:14,200
There's all sorts of stuff happening.

1997
01:53:14,200 --> 01:53:16,840
So that's part of the reason you interview the company.

1998
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:28,160
Think about if the job, hey, job on the team I was with before.

1999
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:32,160
You're going to get to work with film companies on movies

2000
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:34,800
or supporting them and everything,

2001
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:38,680
and then something changes, a need, whatever.

2002
01:53:38,680 --> 01:53:42,040
Hey, we need you to work on the Argonne Exascale computer.

2003
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:46,520
And it depends on what your skill set is and everything,

2004
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:50,360
but that just may become the most important thing.

2005
01:53:50,360 --> 01:53:53,720
So it's more important to think about it

2006
01:53:53,720 --> 01:53:55,720
from a career perspective.

2007
01:53:55,720 --> 01:53:57,760
I'm going to be here three years, five years.

2008
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:00,800
I'm going to keep track of what I want to do.

2009
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:02,560
That will change as you grow.

2010
01:54:02,560 --> 01:54:08,000
But bottom line is I cannot stress enough.

2011
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,080
Don't be afraid to do it.

2012
01:54:10,720 --> 01:54:16,320
Don't sit around for two hours, four hours,

2013
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:19,680
pounding on some problem that you're not convinced

2014
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:22,560
you know what you're supposed to do.

2015
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:24,720
Ask your peer.

2016
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:26,160
You may not want to ask your peer.

2017
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:28,560
By the way, I have it up here.

2018
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:33,120
The other thing is, one, don't be afraid to talk to people.

2019
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:37,400
Watch your emails when they come.

2020
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:40,040
You'll be put on email groups all sorts of different ways.

2021
01:54:40,040 --> 01:54:41,600
All sorts of stuff.

2022
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:44,720
Somebody you didn't interview with, never heard of, whatever,

2023
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:47,840
says something that you worked on in one of your classes.

2024
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:50,720
You never thought you would even see that it was there.

2025
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:52,600
Just go, hey, I worked on this.

2026
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:55,640
Just email them.

2027
01:54:55,640 --> 01:55:03,000
The bottom line is the majority of co-workers at any level

2028
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:06,960
want you to succeed if you've been hired.

2029
01:55:07,160 --> 01:55:13,520
They reserve the right to say, holy crap,

2030
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:18,280
I'm delivering product X. I'm the one on the ball

2031
01:55:18,280 --> 01:55:22,000
here for three weeks, whatever.

2032
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:27,240
They almost always will say, let's catch up after that.

2033
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:30,240
If they're a real jerk, they just won't get back to you

2034
01:55:30,240 --> 01:55:31,240
or whatever.

2035
01:55:31,240 --> 01:55:33,200
But that's going to be so low.

2036
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:39,200
So one, lack of happening.

2037
01:55:39,200 --> 01:55:41,440
The majority of people want you to succeed.

2038
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:44,120
They're good people at every company.

2039
01:55:44,120 --> 01:55:49,640
So the biggest thing you don't want, and by the way,

2040
01:55:49,640 --> 01:55:52,000
your manager might be a jerk.

2041
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:53,600
Just be aware of that.

2042
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:56,400
He may have a great team, though.

2043
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:57,600
He may be distracted.

2044
01:55:57,600 --> 01:55:59,960
He may whatever.

2045
01:55:59,960 --> 01:56:01,120
He or she, I'm sorry.

2046
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:10,640
They could be the greatest mentor you have.

2047
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:12,080
You're going to have to sense that.

2048
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:17,800
More than likely, if they sign the document that

2049
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:21,640
says we're going to hire you, they're

2050
01:56:21,640 --> 01:56:23,640
interested in your success as well.

2051
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:27,520
But the bottom line is, one, don't stick with one mentor,

2052
01:56:27,560 --> 01:56:30,960
two or three.

2053
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:32,760
There's one right here.

2054
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:36,400
There's actually a new one right here.

2055
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:37,720
And oops.

2056
01:56:37,720 --> 01:56:40,720
And yeah, that one, there's questions.

2057
01:56:40,720 --> 01:56:46,280
But remember, larger companies will have some more resources

2058
01:56:46,280 --> 01:56:47,480
for you.

2059
01:56:47,480 --> 01:56:50,040
They're also harder to navigate.

2060
01:56:50,040 --> 01:56:53,360
So I can say network, network, network.

2061
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:54,600
I don't know who to talk to.

2062
01:56:54,640 --> 01:56:57,720
There's 120,000 people here, right?

2063
01:56:57,720 --> 01:57:00,280
But it will work itself out, right?

2064
01:57:00,280 --> 01:57:05,880
And then a key thing is, again, in particular a larger company,

2065
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:08,960
but really any company, if they're worth their while,

2066
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:12,160
they're going to have a quarterly, monthly, whatever

2067
01:57:12,160 --> 01:57:13,320
group you're in.

2068
01:57:13,320 --> 01:57:15,560
There'll be something broader that

2069
01:57:15,560 --> 01:57:17,680
goes around the company's mission and everything.

2070
01:57:17,680 --> 01:57:21,000
Listen, if you didn't get the whole story,

2071
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,040
and you probably didn't of the mission statement

2072
01:57:23,040 --> 01:57:24,800
or the culture or whatever, you're

2073
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:26,480
going to discern it there.

2074
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:31,520
And you then get to participate more and more,

2075
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:38,240
and either get more in or go, holy crap, I shouldn't be here.

2076
01:57:38,240 --> 01:57:40,840
But you're probably going to make the right choice.

2077
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:44,360
It's pretty somewhat intuitive.

2078
01:57:44,360 --> 01:57:47,560
And then just remember, every company

2079
01:57:47,560 --> 01:57:50,360
tries to maximize ROI.

2080
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:54,160
And it's something you don't think a lot about as a

2081
01:57:54,160 --> 01:57:55,560
graduating student or whatever.

2082
01:57:55,560 --> 01:57:58,680
These guys have all the money in the world.

2083
01:57:58,680 --> 01:58:02,000
I mentioned it before about the headcount and everything.

2084
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:05,920
And on tighter times, it's very tight, like one person stuff.

2085
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:09,560
Other times, they might go ahead and hire 100 people.

2086
01:58:09,560 --> 01:58:13,440
So it does depend.

2087
01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:18,560
But try to understand, I'd say, within a year.

2088
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:20,720
You don't have to understand day one.

2089
01:58:20,720 --> 01:58:25,120
Within a year, where do you fit in the company's notion of ROI?

2090
01:58:25,120 --> 01:58:26,640
Let's see if we can figure that out.

2091
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:30,600
It may not matter.

2092
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:34,040
But then what that does, it drives

2093
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:38,400
you to have the company's best interest at heart

2094
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:41,600
while you want the company to have your best interest

2095
01:58:41,600 --> 01:58:42,320
at heart.

2096
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:44,800
And it becomes a virtuous cycle.

2097
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:46,760
So just try to see what you want.

2098
01:58:46,760 --> 01:58:49,020
And with that, I'm done.

2099
01:58:49,020 --> 01:58:50,360
I'm open to any other questions.

2100
01:58:50,360 --> 01:58:50,860
Thank you.

2101
01:58:50,860 --> 01:58:56,440
I'll just add a thought on ROI before I hand it over

2102
01:58:56,440 --> 01:58:57,160
to the students.

2103
01:58:57,160 --> 01:59:01,220
ROI may not always be money.

2104
01:59:01,220 --> 01:59:02,720
Oh, yeah.

2105
01:59:02,720 --> 01:59:06,720
At a company like Cesium, we want to grow the platform first.

2106
01:59:06,720 --> 01:59:08,460
Money may come second.

2107
01:59:08,460 --> 01:59:11,480
At a different company, where open source is very important,

2108
01:59:11,480 --> 01:59:13,960
like, let's say, Red Hat or Kitware

2109
01:59:13,960 --> 01:59:16,260
or companies like that, building the community

2110
01:59:16,260 --> 01:59:19,420
and getting your answer to the question first

2111
01:59:19,420 --> 01:59:21,100
is super important and things like that.

2112
01:59:21,100 --> 01:59:23,620
So again, you want to understand what the ROI is as well

2113
01:59:23,620 --> 01:59:25,660
and what makes your manager successful

2114
01:59:25,660 --> 01:59:27,660
and what makes your manager's manager successful

2115
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:29,140
and things like that as well.

2116
01:59:29,140 --> 01:59:31,380
That's a fantastic point.

2117
01:59:31,380 --> 01:59:34,660
And that's the reason it's called ROI and not

2118
01:59:34,660 --> 01:59:37,460
profit or whatever.

2119
01:59:37,460 --> 01:59:40,820
It is a slightly more amorphous thing,

2120
01:59:40,820 --> 01:59:44,580
although occasionally your manager, most likely,

2121
01:59:44,580 --> 01:59:46,820
eventually you, if you're a manager,

2122
01:59:46,820 --> 01:59:50,500
you actually might have to calculate the ROI in a number.

2123
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:57,260
Like, we spend $10 million on this group in salary

2124
01:59:57,260 --> 02:00:00,300
and benefits and everything else.

2125
02:00:00,300 --> 02:00:08,500
And here, the interesting thing is, what's the numerator?

2126
02:00:08,500 --> 02:00:10,140
Is the numerator money?

2127
02:00:10,140 --> 02:00:11,540
Is the numerator developers?

2128
02:00:11,540 --> 02:00:14,020
Is the numerator?

2129
02:00:14,020 --> 02:00:16,020
And then how does it relate?

2130
02:00:16,020 --> 02:00:20,580
So anyway, the bottom line is, are they happy?

2131
02:00:20,580 --> 02:00:21,740
Are you contributing?

2132
02:00:27,900 --> 02:00:29,820
And how does that vote for the future?

2133
02:00:29,820 --> 02:00:34,300
So other questions, anybody?

2134
02:00:34,300 --> 02:00:36,420
Thank you for your attention as well.

2135
02:00:36,420 --> 02:00:38,500
I know it's a little bit boring sometimes.

2136
02:00:38,500 --> 02:00:41,380
Yeah.

2137
02:00:41,380 --> 02:00:44,740
So you talked a little bit about what

2138
02:00:44,740 --> 02:00:48,220
to do during interviews and what to do once you're on the job.

2139
02:00:48,220 --> 02:00:50,580
But how about actually getting interviews?

2140
02:00:50,580 --> 02:00:55,140
Because that tends to be a struggle sometimes at all.

2141
02:00:55,140 --> 02:00:57,620
When you don't get an interview, you don't get a response,

2142
02:00:57,620 --> 02:00:59,380
or you get rejected, you don't necessarily

2143
02:00:59,380 --> 02:01:00,460
get any feedback, so you don't really

2144
02:01:00,460 --> 02:01:01,700
know where you're going wrong.

2145
02:01:01,700 --> 02:01:02,200
Mm-hmm.

2146
02:01:07,220 --> 02:01:09,860
Yeah, that's a tough one.

2147
02:01:09,860 --> 02:01:10,860
Not that tough, though.

2148
02:01:16,380 --> 02:01:24,020
I think if you, you know, I'll say probably a few bad things

2149
02:01:24,020 --> 02:01:26,580
or good things.

2150
02:01:26,580 --> 02:01:28,700
You're going to have a degree from the university.

2151
02:01:28,700 --> 02:01:29,200
That's OK.

2152
02:01:29,200 --> 02:01:31,380
That's pretty good.

2153
02:01:31,380 --> 02:01:35,700
Just sorry, that's the way it works.

2154
02:01:35,700 --> 02:01:39,140
You know, so you have that as a start.

2155
02:01:39,140 --> 02:01:46,260
If you're seeing those bumps in the road,

2156
02:01:46,260 --> 02:01:50,420
I would say it's likely that you're going too far,

2157
02:01:50,420 --> 02:01:54,540
that you're actually looking for interviews for jobs

2158
02:01:54,540 --> 02:01:58,620
that you may be loosely qualified for.

2159
02:01:58,660 --> 02:02:07,700
So be careful about the blanket, the notion of a, oh,

2160
02:02:07,700 --> 02:02:10,260
I know C++, and there's 10 other things in here

2161
02:02:10,260 --> 02:02:13,660
that I kind of know.

2162
02:02:13,660 --> 02:02:16,780
It goes back to knowing yourself a little bit.

2163
02:02:16,780 --> 02:02:20,780
And so I think there's that.

2164
02:02:20,780 --> 02:02:22,380
Know the market situation.

2165
02:02:22,380 --> 02:02:25,020
I will tell you the market situation

2166
02:02:25,020 --> 02:02:29,500
is briefly tough right now.

2167
02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:38,220
And then the other thing is, it sort of

2168
02:02:38,220 --> 02:02:46,020
relates to the market situation, is you have a sense of urgency

2169
02:02:46,020 --> 02:02:51,900
and the company has a malleable sense of urgency.

2170
02:02:51,900 --> 02:02:53,980
So it's really interesting.

2171
02:02:53,980 --> 02:02:56,820
I will tell you the other thing.

2172
02:02:56,820 --> 02:02:58,780
Sorry, I'm sort of drifting off your time.

2173
02:02:58,780 --> 02:03:04,820
But the bottom line is, I will tell you something.

2174
02:03:04,820 --> 02:03:07,060
This is from an Intel manager perspective,

2175
02:03:07,060 --> 02:03:11,700
I believe, that is very similar at any larger corporation.

2176
02:03:11,700 --> 02:03:15,540
When they say minimum qualifications, they mean it.

2177
02:03:15,540 --> 02:03:18,420
If the job says minimum qualification

2178
02:03:18,420 --> 02:03:21,620
and it's four things, don't apply

2179
02:03:21,620 --> 02:03:23,580
if you don't have four things.

2180
02:03:23,740 --> 02:03:27,940
The recruiter, who I just told you probably doesn't know much,

2181
02:03:27,940 --> 02:03:30,660
will remove you before the manager even sees you.

2182
02:03:30,660 --> 02:03:32,940
It's a waste of your time.

2183
02:03:32,940 --> 02:03:38,380
So make sure that you can speak to the minimum qualifications

2184
02:03:38,380 --> 02:03:40,060
confidently.

2185
02:03:40,060 --> 02:03:41,940
Don't apply if it doesn't fit.

2186
02:03:41,940 --> 02:03:45,300
So I think that's ultimately the fact.

2187
02:03:45,300 --> 02:03:47,140
If it's a well-structured company

2188
02:03:47,140 --> 02:03:51,740
and a well-structured staffing thing,

2189
02:03:51,740 --> 02:03:55,380
if you hit the minimum qualifications,

2190
02:03:55,380 --> 02:03:58,180
then you should apply.

2191
02:03:58,180 --> 02:04:00,500
And you should consider how you address what they

2192
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:04,740
call a plus or additional.

2193
02:04:04,740 --> 02:04:06,300
But if the minimum qualification is

2194
02:04:06,300 --> 02:04:12,660
a PhD in computer graphics, don't do it.

2195
02:04:12,660 --> 02:04:17,900
You're actually in a little way, and the recruiter

2196
02:04:17,900 --> 02:04:20,300
may not screen you out.

2197
02:04:20,300 --> 02:04:23,620
And then the manager goes, why don't you screen this person?

2198
02:04:23,620 --> 02:04:26,300
So there's a little bit of mechanical stuff

2199
02:04:26,300 --> 02:04:28,260
with that thing.

2200
02:04:28,260 --> 02:04:29,860
The other thing I want to say, though,

2201
02:04:29,860 --> 02:04:35,820
is see if you notice when you're interviewing.

2202
02:04:35,820 --> 02:04:39,340
Try to have a sense of what I would call in the big flips.

2203
02:04:42,660 --> 02:04:48,940
And that is when they go from interviewing you

2204
02:04:48,940 --> 02:04:55,140
to figuring out how they can land you.

2205
02:04:55,140 --> 02:05:00,220
It is almost instantaneous, typically.

2206
02:05:00,220 --> 02:05:04,420
Or sometimes it's the second interview process or whatever.

2207
02:05:04,420 --> 02:05:05,980
Sometimes it's not.

2208
02:05:05,980 --> 02:05:08,260
Sometimes they have, you know, there's

2209
02:05:08,260 --> 02:05:10,260
all sorts of ways of doing this.

2210
02:05:10,260 --> 02:05:13,340
But in this market for engineers,

2211
02:05:13,340 --> 02:05:16,820
I think what I've seen in my behavior

2212
02:05:16,820 --> 02:05:23,060
was there's just a moment where I go, oh, they

2213
02:05:23,060 --> 02:05:26,460
nailed everything.

2214
02:05:26,460 --> 02:05:35,420
And just one, be careful to oversell yourself.

2215
02:05:35,420 --> 02:05:36,300
Check it.

2216
02:05:36,300 --> 02:05:43,020
But now that's another point to show you have job interest.

2217
02:05:43,020 --> 02:05:45,060
That's when you start asking culture questions

2218
02:05:45,100 --> 02:05:48,620
and things like, if you haven't done it yet, it's OK to do it.

2219
02:05:48,620 --> 02:05:56,580
But see if you can learn that skill of the bit flipping.

2220
02:05:56,580 --> 02:05:59,940
I think, Jim, if I can add, because I do this all

2221
02:05:59,940 --> 02:06:03,460
the time, and I'm realizing, as you say,

2222
02:06:03,460 --> 02:06:05,580
the person you're interviewing with,

2223
02:06:05,580 --> 02:06:07,740
whether it's a technical manager at HR,

2224
02:06:07,740 --> 02:06:09,980
they go from telling you about something

2225
02:06:09,980 --> 02:06:12,300
to selling you on something.

2226
02:06:12,300 --> 02:06:15,060
I think that's like, it's not always obvious.

2227
02:06:15,060 --> 02:06:17,980
But if you notice it in their form,

2228
02:06:17,980 --> 02:06:21,260
that's when you can notice it.

2229
02:06:21,260 --> 02:06:21,740
Yeah.

2230
02:06:21,740 --> 02:06:24,900
I mean, you don't have to go crazy when that happens.

2231
02:06:24,900 --> 02:06:27,020
And you could be wrong.

2232
02:06:27,020 --> 02:06:28,620
It could be the person's personality,

2233
02:06:28,620 --> 02:06:31,420
particularly if it's HR or something like that.

2234
02:06:31,420 --> 02:06:34,300
They may just have a thing.

2235
02:06:34,300 --> 02:06:41,140
But in particular, if the hiring manager goes into,

2236
02:06:41,140 --> 02:06:43,300
they'll sell you from the beginning.

2237
02:06:43,300 --> 02:06:45,940
They're going to assume it'll work out,

2238
02:06:45,940 --> 02:06:47,300
and you're navigating.

2239
02:06:47,300 --> 02:06:51,340
But there's a point at which they're there in that.

2240
02:06:51,340 --> 02:06:57,460
Just keep that in mind, because you have a little bit of power

2241
02:06:57,460 --> 02:06:59,740
at that point.

2242
02:06:59,740 --> 02:07:02,940
Because going back to everything I said,

2243
02:07:02,940 --> 02:07:05,700
the reality in the background, in the back office

2244
02:07:05,700 --> 02:07:10,340
and everything is, if they don't place somebody

2245
02:07:10,340 --> 02:07:15,540
in a reasonable period of time, it'll go away.

2246
02:07:15,540 --> 02:07:17,740
The recruiters will start emailing.

2247
02:07:17,740 --> 02:07:20,420
Is this thing still a legitimate job?

2248
02:07:20,420 --> 02:07:21,780
Whatever.

2249
02:07:21,780 --> 02:07:25,340
I had a very, for a while, and it's become better.

2250
02:07:25,340 --> 02:07:28,060
It became better towards the end.

2251
02:07:28,060 --> 02:07:32,820
But four or five years ago, I was there like, hey, recruiter,

2252
02:07:32,820 --> 02:07:34,540
just be aware.

2253
02:07:34,540 --> 02:07:38,980
I may not get even close to a resume for someone

2254
02:07:38,980 --> 02:07:41,220
who meets the minimum qualifications for nine months.

2255
02:07:44,380 --> 02:07:45,740
It's a little bit different now.

2256
02:07:45,740 --> 02:07:50,500
But for what I was hiring and what I needed to do and get

2257
02:07:50,500 --> 02:07:55,740
done, I could not hire what we euphemistically

2258
02:07:55,740 --> 02:07:57,540
call a boat anchor.

2259
02:07:57,540 --> 02:08:00,500
A unicorn.

2260
02:08:00,500 --> 02:08:05,860
Somebody who you invest in, who brings zero ROI,

2261
02:08:05,860 --> 02:08:07,860
or negative ROI, as they say.

2262
02:08:07,860 --> 02:08:15,140
So it depends on the circumstances.

2263
02:08:15,140 --> 02:08:17,180
They may be hiring cogs in the wheel.

2264
02:08:17,180 --> 02:08:20,620
And if you have a minimum thing, that's fine.

2265
02:08:20,620 --> 02:08:22,380
But it depends on the circumstance.

2266
02:08:22,380 --> 02:08:29,140
But just note, at a minimum, feel good

2267
02:08:29,140 --> 02:08:34,500
that somebody loves you.

2268
02:08:34,500 --> 02:08:36,620
It still may not work out.

2269
02:08:36,620 --> 02:08:39,660
At the same time, though, when they flip that bit,

2270
02:08:39,660 --> 02:08:44,660
now you begin to become the decider.

2271
02:08:44,660 --> 02:08:47,580
In the end, you're the decider.

2272
02:08:47,580 --> 02:08:49,820
That's the beauty of the job thing.

2273
02:08:49,820 --> 02:08:51,820
It's a pain in the butt.

2274
02:08:51,820 --> 02:08:55,860
It's stressful, all this other stuff.

2275
02:08:55,860 --> 02:08:56,420
What do I do?

2276
02:08:56,420 --> 02:08:57,460
What do I do?

2277
02:08:57,460 --> 02:09:00,140
But eventually, you're in control.

2278
02:09:00,140 --> 02:09:05,140
A offer comes, one or more companies,

2279
02:09:05,140 --> 02:09:08,460
and you decide whether you want to do this or not.

2280
02:09:08,460 --> 02:09:15,700
And they'll usually be begging you to land it.

2281
02:09:15,700 --> 02:09:18,500
And part of it is simply mechanical.

2282
02:09:18,500 --> 02:09:23,180
They see the value in what you have

2283
02:09:23,180 --> 02:09:26,180
and want to get you on board as quickly as possible.

2284
02:09:26,180 --> 02:09:29,420
Still, make sure you do what's right for you.

2285
02:09:29,420 --> 02:09:34,820
The right company and the right organization, I don't know.

2286
02:09:34,820 --> 02:09:37,900
You're getting married the day after you graduate,

2287
02:09:37,900 --> 02:09:41,940
or you've promised your family you're

2288
02:09:41,940 --> 02:09:44,500
going to go on a four-week thing or whatever.

2289
02:09:44,500 --> 02:09:47,100
And they say, no, we want you to do it.

2290
02:09:47,100 --> 02:09:50,020
If they say no, that's almost certainly not

2291
02:09:50,020 --> 02:09:54,140
the company for you, right?

2292
02:09:54,140 --> 02:09:57,020
Again, but if you're in a money situation or whatever,

2293
02:09:57,020 --> 02:09:58,940
and you just want to get something in.

2294
02:09:58,940 --> 02:10:00,500
So it's relative.

2295
02:10:00,540 --> 02:10:06,020
But anyway, I would just, that's the final piece of advice.

2296
02:10:06,020 --> 02:10:11,540
And that really comes down to be yourself in a way.

2297
02:10:11,540 --> 02:10:13,140
Don't beg them for the job.

2298
02:10:15,700 --> 02:10:22,980
And don't try to say anything to get the job.

2299
02:10:22,980 --> 02:10:28,660
That actually is very easily detectable.

2300
02:10:28,660 --> 02:10:33,060
And it's just not well-received by the team.

2301
02:10:33,060 --> 02:10:36,380
You are going to become part of a team,

2302
02:10:36,380 --> 02:10:38,180
whether you call it a cog or whether you

2303
02:10:38,180 --> 02:10:44,980
call it an important aspect of the team.

2304
02:10:44,980 --> 02:10:46,300
And they want you to succeed.

2305
02:10:46,300 --> 02:10:48,380
Like I said, they don't want you to start off

2306
02:10:48,380 --> 02:10:49,540
on the wrong foot, so.

2307
02:10:52,340 --> 02:10:53,740
OK?

2308
02:10:53,740 --> 02:10:55,780
Anybody else?

2309
02:10:55,780 --> 02:10:57,100
Yes?

2310
02:10:57,100 --> 02:11:01,460
I was just interested in their perspective on Agile,

2311
02:11:01,460 --> 02:11:04,700
specifically for graphics development.

2312
02:11:04,700 --> 02:11:08,980
Since I think most graphics apps have a much slower release

2313
02:11:08,980 --> 02:11:09,980
schedule.

2314
02:11:09,980 --> 02:11:11,780
Or I don't know, if you're making a movie,

2315
02:11:11,780 --> 02:11:13,260
you don't even care about the code.

2316
02:11:13,260 --> 02:11:15,300
You just output the movie.

2317
02:11:15,300 --> 02:11:18,340
So I was wondering how that works,

2318
02:11:18,340 --> 02:11:22,540
or kind of goes against Agile, or when you might

2319
02:11:22,540 --> 02:11:24,340
use it more in waterfall approach.

2320
02:11:28,100 --> 02:11:34,980
I've sort of come to feel that waterfall is the one.

2321
02:11:34,980 --> 02:11:38,580
I think that's a general agreement in the wider

2322
02:11:38,580 --> 02:11:39,080
industry.

2323
02:11:39,080 --> 02:11:40,660
Yeah, yeah.

2324
02:11:40,660 --> 02:11:48,340
So maybe I'll call it traditional waterfall.

2325
02:11:48,340 --> 02:11:51,460
There are, I would say, unfortunately,

2326
02:11:51,460 --> 02:11:54,020
a lot of software engineering organizations

2327
02:11:54,020 --> 02:11:55,500
that call what they're doing Agile,

2328
02:11:55,500 --> 02:12:00,380
and it's actually waterfall, which is really frustrating.

2329
02:12:00,380 --> 02:12:06,140
But I am not aware in my, I'm starting off

2330
02:12:06,140 --> 02:12:08,620
the waterfall list that I learned about Agile

2331
02:12:08,620 --> 02:12:09,460
and everything.

2332
02:12:09,460 --> 02:12:12,460
And so I'll sort of go back to what I said.

2333
02:12:12,460 --> 02:12:14,820
Agile is a tool bag.

2334
02:12:14,820 --> 02:12:19,940
It's a lot of people, in my experience,

2335
02:12:19,940 --> 02:12:22,940
a lot of people want to Agile, think of it

2336
02:12:22,940 --> 02:12:26,420
as an actual process.

2337
02:12:26,420 --> 02:12:26,980
You do this.

2338
02:12:26,980 --> 02:12:29,380
You have stand-up meetings.

2339
02:12:29,380 --> 02:12:35,500
And I've come to the conclusion that there's

2340
02:12:35,500 --> 02:12:39,180
nothing wrong with that process in the right circumstance.

2341
02:12:39,180 --> 02:12:45,340
Probably web design probably fits the classic Agile.

2342
02:12:45,340 --> 02:12:47,180
Or now it's called classic.

2343
02:12:47,180 --> 02:12:51,100
It's doing user stories, and da-da-da-da-da, all that stuff.

2344
02:12:51,100 --> 02:12:55,380
Something like web design probably benefits from it.

2345
02:12:55,380 --> 02:12:58,820
And by the way, there's a crap load of web designers, right?

2346
02:12:58,820 --> 02:13:02,220
So it may, from a standpoint of how many projects

2347
02:13:02,220 --> 02:13:06,540
are the full blown Agile with 90% of the processes,

2348
02:13:06,540 --> 02:13:10,180
I mean, 50% or more, whatever.

2349
02:13:10,180 --> 02:13:12,780
To your question, though, in graphics and GPU

2350
02:13:12,780 --> 02:13:15,460
and performance programming and everything else,

2351
02:13:15,460 --> 02:13:20,500
I think you want to select the Agile processes that

2352
02:13:20,500 --> 02:13:27,540
map to how you deliver to users, what the user base is,

2353
02:13:27,540 --> 02:13:29,140
what their concerns are.

2354
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:36,020
And as much as I like Agile and just

2355
02:13:36,020 --> 02:13:40,460
threw waterfall under the bus, my inkling in that thing

2356
02:13:40,460 --> 02:13:45,180
is to use the least amount of Agile tools that you can.

2357
02:13:45,180 --> 02:13:47,460
Don't get caught up in it.

2358
02:13:47,460 --> 02:13:53,780
And that's where I really come down to the tools

2359
02:13:53,780 --> 02:14:00,300
that I have found work best in a graphics or a performance

2360
02:14:00,300 --> 02:14:01,900
or a compute.

2361
02:14:01,900 --> 02:14:06,940
Where the performance is the deliverable

2362
02:14:06,940 --> 02:14:13,260
is a feature backlog, a prioritized feature

2363
02:14:13,260 --> 02:14:16,020
or capability backlog, if you will.

2364
02:14:16,060 --> 02:14:19,660
So you always should have a backlog of things

2365
02:14:19,660 --> 02:14:21,900
you want to do prioritized.

2366
02:14:26,340 --> 02:14:32,100
And then somewhere between monthly and quarterly,

2367
02:14:32,100 --> 02:14:34,940
I think, and you were kind of addressing it with,

2368
02:14:34,940 --> 02:14:39,540
I mean, some projects are yearly with graphics drivers.

2369
02:14:39,540 --> 02:14:44,540
My guess is internally, though, they're monthly or quarterly.

2370
02:14:44,540 --> 02:14:46,860
But the beauty of Agile, and the other thing

2371
02:14:46,860 --> 02:14:50,460
I like about Agile is it's ready to ship.

2372
02:14:50,460 --> 02:14:54,140
But for market reasons, you can choose not to ship it,

2373
02:14:54,140 --> 02:14:57,300
whatever that market reason is.

2374
02:14:57,300 --> 02:15:01,820
So I like the readiness of your code

2375
02:15:01,820 --> 02:15:04,540
there, but the test-driven development.

2376
02:15:04,540 --> 02:15:08,020
So I think the backlog, test-driven development,

2377
02:15:08,020 --> 02:15:11,180
and automated testing.

2378
02:15:11,180 --> 02:15:13,180
I'm going to tell you something that I probably

2379
02:15:13,180 --> 02:15:15,260
shouldn't tell you.

2380
02:15:15,260 --> 02:15:17,980
So I don't know how much recording is going on.

2381
02:15:22,220 --> 02:15:27,100
I didn't have the memorizing quality, fidelity, everything.

2382
02:15:27,100 --> 02:15:29,140
That's what Jim's about.

2383
02:15:29,140 --> 02:15:33,060
Jim, as a technical manager, I didn't

2384
02:15:33,060 --> 02:15:36,540
have a validation engineer on my team.

2385
02:15:36,540 --> 02:15:39,380
I didn't have a person who was responsible for Agile.

2386
02:15:39,380 --> 02:15:42,420
They were computers.

2387
02:15:42,420 --> 02:15:48,180
Now, I did have what I call build, release, and CI

2388
02:15:48,180 --> 02:15:50,860
development engineers.

2389
02:15:50,860 --> 02:15:52,500
They were putting the tools in place,

2390
02:15:52,500 --> 02:15:55,140
make sure they were robust, make sure they weren't failing,

2391
02:15:55,140 --> 02:15:56,580
all that stuff.

2392
02:15:56,580 --> 02:16:00,820
But test-driven development supported

2393
02:16:00,820 --> 02:16:08,340
by extensive automation, well-written automation,

2394
02:16:08,340 --> 02:16:13,140
quality, fidelity, performance in the automation part

2395
02:16:13,140 --> 02:16:19,260
is, to me, the key to ultimately delivering quality

2396
02:16:19,260 --> 02:16:25,700
where, at a minimum, the obvious and the majority of edge cases

2397
02:16:25,700 --> 02:16:29,100
never are encountered by an end user.

2398
02:16:29,100 --> 02:16:32,100
Most of our end users were either

2399
02:16:32,100 --> 02:16:36,180
trying to do something we hadn't implemented yet and thought,

2400
02:16:36,180 --> 02:16:38,340
well, this must work, or whatever.

2401
02:16:38,340 --> 02:16:42,100
And we're getting maybe not wrong answers.

2402
02:16:42,100 --> 02:16:45,700
We're getting weird stuff.

2403
02:16:45,700 --> 02:16:47,540
We're going, why doesn't this work?

2404
02:16:47,540 --> 02:16:50,260
We tell you in the release notes it doesn't work.

2405
02:16:50,260 --> 02:16:51,060
That kind of thing.

2406
02:16:51,060 --> 02:17:00,220
But anyway, that's from a graphics standpoint

2407
02:17:00,220 --> 02:17:03,220
and performance programming standpoint.

2408
02:17:03,220 --> 02:17:10,380
I think the judicious use of the backlog.

2409
02:17:10,380 --> 02:17:13,340
And I have another footnote.

2410
02:17:13,340 --> 02:17:15,020
Do people like my philosophies?

2411
02:17:15,020 --> 02:17:17,580
You guys like them?

2412
02:17:17,580 --> 02:17:18,580
There's one other.

2413
02:17:18,580 --> 02:17:20,620
It just occurred to me, a philosophy

2414
02:17:20,620 --> 02:17:26,660
that I expelled that caused a number of people

2415
02:17:26,660 --> 02:17:31,420
who maybe would listen to my thing about Agile.

2416
02:17:31,420 --> 02:17:35,580
But would say, OK, we sort of do Agile,

2417
02:17:35,580 --> 02:17:39,180
but there's so many problems with that.

2418
02:17:39,180 --> 02:17:43,860
There's another philosophy that's around the backlog.

2419
02:17:43,860 --> 02:17:47,620
And you guys, everybody know what a LIFO and a FIFO is?

2420
02:17:47,620 --> 02:17:48,120
Right?

2421
02:17:52,100 --> 02:17:56,780
Most features, particularly the most compelling features

2422
02:17:56,780 --> 02:18:01,300
that you have not yet implemented

2423
02:18:01,300 --> 02:18:06,460
should generally be done in a LIFO, not a FIFO.

2424
02:18:06,460 --> 02:18:10,380
Which means the last idea that just came in

2425
02:18:10,380 --> 02:18:14,340
from a combination of a customer, a receiver,

2426
02:18:14,340 --> 02:18:21,340
and everything, that idea or feature request or capability

2427
02:18:21,340 --> 02:18:25,540
is very likely the highest priority one

2428
02:18:25,540 --> 02:18:28,220
that you should consider.

2429
02:18:28,220 --> 02:18:30,540
And that's why I talk about a backlog and a prioritized

2430
02:18:30,540 --> 02:18:32,460
backlog.

2431
02:18:32,460 --> 02:18:37,900
That almost always has more market knowledge.

2432
02:18:37,900 --> 02:18:38,540
Right?

2433
02:18:38,540 --> 02:18:41,460
It's collective market knowledge comes in.

2434
02:18:41,460 --> 02:18:45,060
Customer, multiple customer, whatever, say,

2435
02:18:45,060 --> 02:18:50,580
if you only did this, my job would be easier.

2436
02:18:50,580 --> 02:18:54,300
The majority of software organizations I've seen

2437
02:18:54,300 --> 02:18:57,660
do LIFO.

2438
02:18:57,660 --> 02:18:58,420
OK?

2439
02:18:58,420 --> 02:19:03,100
We lock it down for a year, OK?

2440
02:19:03,100 --> 02:19:11,620
And they are not Agile enough to do LIFO unless it literally

2441
02:19:11,620 --> 02:19:12,700
is life or death.

2442
02:19:12,700 --> 02:19:17,140
Like, if I don't get this, you lose a billion dollars

2443
02:19:17,140 --> 02:19:19,100
in sales, right?

2444
02:19:19,100 --> 02:19:24,580
Then that will trouble everything.

2445
02:19:24,580 --> 02:19:30,020
But my experience, and I've said this very, very often,

2446
02:19:30,020 --> 02:19:32,860
and got shot down a million times,

2447
02:19:32,860 --> 02:19:37,180
as I always said, the last thing is probably the most important.

2448
02:19:37,180 --> 02:19:41,020
And certain managers say, yeah, yeah, you're right, but.

2449
02:19:41,020 --> 02:19:42,660
And I'm like, why are you saying but?

2450
02:19:42,660 --> 02:19:44,940
We're structured to do this.

2451
02:19:44,940 --> 02:19:46,700
Let's do it.

2452
02:19:46,700 --> 02:19:52,180
Yeah, but you promised feature Y in August.

2453
02:19:52,180 --> 02:19:54,420
Feature Y is not important anymore.

2454
02:19:54,420 --> 02:19:59,860
Or you could get into a bigger organization, product

2455
02:19:59,860 --> 02:20:02,100
management, all these other people get involved.

2456
02:20:02,100 --> 02:20:04,660
And they go, yeah, we lose $100 million here, and da, da, da.

2457
02:20:04,660 --> 02:20:06,500
And you start getting into this contest.

2458
02:20:06,500 --> 02:20:09,740
But to me, from a mid- to long-term standpoint,

2459
02:20:09,740 --> 02:20:14,140
or even a near-term standpoint, if everybody goes, oh my god,

2460
02:20:14,140 --> 02:20:19,580
I wish I had thought of this, that last feature really

2461
02:20:19,580 --> 02:20:20,820
needs to be considered.

2462
02:20:20,820 --> 02:20:28,260
So that's just another twist on the three letters.

2463
02:20:28,260 --> 02:20:35,900
Feature LIFO is, to me, the true agile.

2464
02:20:35,900 --> 02:20:39,700
It actually is the driver of true agile processes.

2465
02:20:39,700 --> 02:20:44,020
And if you have a FIFO process, you'd

2466
02:20:44,060 --> 02:20:45,700
have all sorts of agile processes.

2467
02:20:45,700 --> 02:20:49,020
But the FIFO receiving, the receiving process

2468
02:20:49,020 --> 02:20:58,260
that turns into a FIFO, is heading towards waterfall.

2469
02:21:01,420 --> 02:21:03,180
And again, there's all sorts of arguments.

2470
02:21:03,180 --> 02:21:04,940
You can have discussions and everything.

2471
02:21:04,940 --> 02:21:08,100
It's about the window of time, like I said.

2472
02:21:08,100 --> 02:21:10,700
But typically, we would lock down

2473
02:21:11,100 --> 02:21:12,700
on a month or a quarterly basis.

2474
02:21:18,340 --> 02:21:21,420
I'll go with about 33% of the time.

2475
02:21:21,420 --> 02:21:27,500
The thing we started with on my team,

2476
02:21:27,500 --> 02:21:34,700
we ended up developing a portion of it, shelving it.

2477
02:21:34,700 --> 02:21:36,500
And if we had time, we would do that.

2478
02:21:36,500 --> 02:21:38,140
We would squeeze it in.

2479
02:21:38,140 --> 02:21:40,060
Now, we had the option of not doing that.

2480
02:21:40,420 --> 02:21:42,180
It would depend on timing and everything.

2481
02:21:42,180 --> 02:21:43,820
But I did follow that.

2482
02:21:43,820 --> 02:21:44,940
I said, shelve it.

2483
02:21:44,940 --> 02:21:46,460
Bring it back later.

2484
02:21:46,460 --> 02:21:48,100
Can we get it done?

2485
02:21:48,100 --> 02:21:50,540
Let's go all out and do that.

2486
02:21:50,540 --> 02:21:52,820
So I did try to follow my own thing.

2487
02:21:52,820 --> 02:22:00,060
But again, it really depends on the agile flow that you have.

2488
02:22:00,060 --> 02:22:03,780
Just to add to what you said, from a creative perspective,

2489
02:22:03,780 --> 02:22:06,260
where software is not involved, like the movie industries

2490
02:22:06,260 --> 02:22:08,820
where you might be doing animation and stuff,

2491
02:22:08,860 --> 02:22:11,100
you probably want to read Creativity, Inc.

2492
02:22:11,100 --> 02:22:12,900
It's a book by Ed Kastner, and it

2493
02:22:12,900 --> 02:22:16,100
details Pixar's work culture in that.

2494
02:22:16,100 --> 02:22:17,660
I don't think he ever calls it agile,

2495
02:22:17,660 --> 02:22:19,380
but there are certainly principles of it.

2496
02:22:19,380 --> 02:22:21,860
So Creativity, Inc. by Ed Kastner.

2497
02:22:21,860 --> 02:22:22,820
Really good book.

2498
02:22:22,820 --> 02:22:25,660
Yep.

2499
02:22:25,660 --> 02:22:28,780
Great question, though.

2500
02:22:28,780 --> 02:22:30,780
Do you have any thoughts on job hopping?

2501
02:22:30,780 --> 02:22:33,020
Or once a good time, job hopping?

2502
02:22:33,020 --> 02:22:35,620
Not now.

2503
02:22:35,620 --> 02:22:36,580
Who would ever do that?

2504
02:22:38,820 --> 02:22:45,260
I don't have a ton of thoughts.

2505
02:22:45,260 --> 02:22:58,500
I think it realistically, I probably waited too long.

2506
02:22:58,500 --> 02:22:59,780
That's always the hindsight.

2507
02:22:59,780 --> 02:23:01,180
Yeah.

2508
02:23:01,180 --> 02:23:02,100
Yeah, that's true.

2509
02:23:02,100 --> 02:23:03,180
It's always the hindsight.

2510
02:23:04,180 --> 02:23:06,460
I think it really, again, for me,

2511
02:23:06,460 --> 02:23:11,060
and this depends on where you are in your career, to me,

2512
02:23:11,060 --> 02:23:14,780
by the time I'm at this stage of my career,

2513
02:23:14,780 --> 02:23:18,860
the actual culture and what I can actually

2514
02:23:18,860 --> 02:23:25,140
impact in the world is most important to me.

2515
02:23:25,140 --> 02:23:28,540
And so it is kind of individual.

2516
02:23:28,540 --> 02:23:31,580
It is kind of career-oriented.

2517
02:23:31,700 --> 02:23:35,740
It is kind of career-oriented.

2518
02:23:35,740 --> 02:23:38,340
I would avoid doing it early.

2519
02:23:38,340 --> 02:23:46,580
So I think a reasonable situation, particularly

2520
02:23:46,580 --> 02:23:50,300
earlier, the bottom line is the likelihood I've seen

2521
02:23:50,300 --> 02:23:54,060
is as earlier in your career, you

2522
02:23:54,060 --> 02:23:57,460
would do it a little bit more until you settle in,

2523
02:23:57,460 --> 02:24:00,460
because you need that experience.

2524
02:24:00,460 --> 02:24:03,220
You need to gain some wisdom, if that's the right word,

2525
02:24:03,220 --> 02:24:06,380
or gain some experience.

2526
02:24:06,380 --> 02:24:08,500
And yeah, your first job, you are going

2527
02:24:08,500 --> 02:24:11,860
to kind of dive in head first.

2528
02:24:11,860 --> 02:24:14,660
As much as I gave you all this advice,

2529
02:24:14,660 --> 02:24:17,260
it's not going to apply every time or whatever.

2530
02:24:17,260 --> 02:24:25,220
So in a technology situation, yeah, I

2531
02:24:25,220 --> 02:24:30,500
think three to five years would make sense to a hiring manager.

2532
02:24:35,220 --> 02:24:38,780
But if you do do it, if you do, or when you do it,

2533
02:24:38,780 --> 02:24:46,820
I should say, not if, your obvious question, why now?

2534
02:24:49,660 --> 02:24:54,060
So in a weird way, I would refrain

2535
02:24:54,100 --> 02:24:56,500
from calling it job hopping.

2536
02:24:56,500 --> 02:25:01,140
I would say it would be career planning.

2537
02:25:01,140 --> 02:25:03,780
And so if you kind of get rid of that notion

2538
02:25:03,780 --> 02:25:09,100
that it's a job hop for the sake of job hopping,

2539
02:25:09,100 --> 02:25:18,660
make it a career decision that could,

2540
02:25:18,660 --> 02:25:21,300
just like the movies or whatever,

2541
02:25:21,660 --> 02:25:24,140
could be you didn't get that promo,

2542
02:25:24,140 --> 02:25:28,060
or you didn't get that internal job, or whatever.

2543
02:25:28,060 --> 02:25:30,660
There could be a straw, as you will,

2544
02:25:30,660 --> 02:25:38,300
if broke the camel's back, or a feeling that maybe there's

2545
02:25:38,300 --> 02:25:40,340
something more you could do out there.

2546
02:25:40,340 --> 02:25:46,340
So it's more like have a reasonable reason for doing it,

2547
02:25:46,340 --> 02:25:47,780
and then be honest with yourself,

2548
02:25:47,780 --> 02:25:53,380
and be as honest as you can be with the employer.

2549
02:25:53,380 --> 02:25:55,500
There may be things you can't be honest about,

2550
02:25:55,500 --> 02:25:58,660
like, I don't know, something that

2551
02:25:58,660 --> 02:26:02,900
would detract from the prior company or whatever that

2552
02:26:02,900 --> 02:26:06,500
doesn't look good on you anyway.

2553
02:26:06,500 --> 02:26:08,340
And so you do have to be careful.

2554
02:26:08,340 --> 02:26:10,220
There are things at a company that you cannot

2555
02:26:10,220 --> 02:26:12,980
reveal to your next company, and they

2556
02:26:12,980 --> 02:26:16,220
may have to do with people and processes.

2557
02:26:16,220 --> 02:26:18,860
That's why I just told you, it's a little bit shaky

2558
02:26:18,860 --> 02:26:22,540
that I said I had no validation people.

2559
02:26:22,540 --> 02:26:24,100
But it's pretty well known.

2560
02:26:24,100 --> 02:26:26,660
I think I said that publicly anyway, and nobody stopped me.

2561
02:26:26,660 --> 02:26:31,740
But yeah, make it a career decision.

2562
02:26:31,740 --> 02:26:36,500
Make sure that there's an element of that.

2563
02:26:36,500 --> 02:26:38,660
Could be I need to move back home,

2564
02:26:38,660 --> 02:26:43,260
or I need to move to California, or whatever it is.

2565
02:26:43,260 --> 02:26:45,380
Could be a perfectly good reason.

2566
02:26:45,380 --> 02:26:46,460
You're not job hopping.

2567
02:26:46,460 --> 02:26:52,420
You're life hopping, or life doing it.

2568
02:26:52,420 --> 02:26:59,780
But the bottom line is every interviewer, every person,

2569
02:26:59,780 --> 02:27:03,140
from the technical person to somebody

2570
02:27:03,140 --> 02:27:06,940
you're going to work with, they're going to squeeze in,

2571
02:27:06,940 --> 02:27:09,580
why are you leaving your current job?

2572
02:27:09,580 --> 02:27:12,620
Just make sure you have a good answer to that,

2573
02:27:12,620 --> 02:27:15,540
a good, honest answer to that.

2574
02:27:15,540 --> 02:27:19,740
If your resume says you've been changing jobs clockwork

2575
02:27:19,740 --> 02:27:22,220
18 months, I'm not hiring you.

2576
02:27:22,220 --> 02:27:24,300
It's kind of like that.

2577
02:27:24,300 --> 02:27:26,220
I think Rev was here last year.

2578
02:27:26,220 --> 02:27:27,820
He did a virtual lecture.

2579
02:27:27,820 --> 02:27:31,820
He said at NVIDIA, I don't know if it's true for all of NVIDIA

2580
02:27:31,820 --> 02:27:33,980
or just personal opinion, but he said

2581
02:27:33,980 --> 02:27:37,540
it takes any new person, regardless

2582
02:27:37,540 --> 02:27:39,540
of a new grad or a senior person,

2583
02:27:39,540 --> 02:27:42,940
two years to add value to the company.

2584
02:27:42,940 --> 02:27:45,300
And if you're not going to stay for two years,

2585
02:27:45,300 --> 02:27:47,820
why am I investing my time in you?

2586
02:27:47,820 --> 02:27:49,220
That's pretty normal.

2587
02:27:49,220 --> 02:27:55,140
One depends on the person and how aligned they are.

2588
02:27:55,140 --> 02:28:01,020
Sometimes you get, I happened to hire a perfect person

2589
02:28:01,020 --> 02:28:03,220
for Intel, and they were contributing in four weeks.

2590
02:28:03,220 --> 02:28:05,740
But they've worked on our technology.

2591
02:28:05,740 --> 02:28:08,020
That's one of the beauties of open source,

2592
02:28:08,020 --> 02:28:10,860
is if they touched our technology or whatever,

2593
02:28:10,860 --> 02:28:13,900
they were able to contribute.

2594
02:28:13,900 --> 02:28:20,060
But the average is the fastest people are 12 months.

2595
02:28:20,060 --> 02:28:25,180
And the average person, not through their own fault,

2596
02:28:25,180 --> 02:28:28,140
but just through the complexity of the company

2597
02:28:28,140 --> 02:28:30,340
and the strategies and all that stuff,

2598
02:28:30,340 --> 02:28:33,940
you can know all the mission statement and everything.

2599
02:28:34,940 --> 02:28:38,340
I just was going through.

2600
02:28:38,340 --> 02:28:43,940
I had, what, an hour, new employee orientation

2601
02:28:43,940 --> 02:28:46,980
at a high level about what NVIDIA does.

2602
02:28:46,980 --> 02:28:51,740
And my brain was ready to explode.

2603
02:28:51,740 --> 02:28:55,820
And I'm coming from the largest computational company

2604
02:28:55,820 --> 02:28:59,180
in the world and have a pretty good sense of what Intel does.

2605
02:28:59,180 --> 02:29:02,420
So anyway, the bottom line is Shizan's right.

2606
02:29:04,780 --> 02:29:10,460
Somewhere around the third hop within two years each

2607
02:29:10,460 --> 02:29:12,460
will begin to be questioned.

2608
02:29:12,460 --> 02:29:16,740
If it's family issues or move, that's

2609
02:29:16,740 --> 02:29:18,980
a little bit more explainable as long as they're real.

2610
02:29:21,980 --> 02:29:26,820
So don't take it I'm giving you an excuse to say.

2611
02:29:26,820 --> 02:29:30,180
And the bottom line is, if by nature

2612
02:29:30,180 --> 02:29:32,860
it happened for a good reason, you

2613
02:29:32,860 --> 02:29:37,740
just have to be honest about it and maybe be upfront about it.

2614
02:29:37,740 --> 02:29:41,060
This is your third hop.

2615
02:29:41,060 --> 02:29:43,580
Look, let's get the elephant out of the room.

2616
02:29:43,580 --> 02:29:46,980
They'll respect you a ton for that.

2617
02:29:46,980 --> 02:29:50,580
One last question before we get going.

2618
02:29:50,580 --> 02:29:52,900
I just wanted to ask about why you switched over

2619
02:29:52,900 --> 02:29:54,820
from Intel to NVIDIA.

2620
02:29:54,820 --> 02:29:55,900
Was there something new?

2621
02:29:55,900 --> 02:29:58,860
Yeah, you're not supposed to take my advice

2622
02:29:58,860 --> 02:30:01,580
and turn it around.

2623
02:30:01,780 --> 02:30:03,380
Was there anything new and interesting

2624
02:30:03,380 --> 02:30:06,140
that you were given an opportunity to work on

2625
02:30:06,140 --> 02:30:10,540
that you couldn't work on without Intel?

2626
02:30:10,540 --> 02:30:13,260
Let me try to answer this delicately.

2627
02:30:13,260 --> 02:30:18,580
When you're a more technical senior person than Intel,

2628
02:30:18,580 --> 02:30:23,780
I had an interesting dual role as what's

2629
02:30:23,780 --> 02:30:25,740
called a senior principal engineer as well

2630
02:30:25,740 --> 02:30:27,740
as a senior director.

2631
02:30:27,740 --> 02:30:31,060
Actually, NVIDIA would let me do that.

2632
02:30:31,860 --> 02:30:35,060
I think for the students here, because they

2633
02:30:35,060 --> 02:30:37,060
don't know all the titles and the dynamics,

2634
02:30:37,060 --> 02:30:38,420
I think what you're trying to say

2635
02:30:38,420 --> 02:30:41,580
is you were both a very senior engineer in your own right,

2636
02:30:41,580 --> 02:30:43,660
but you were also people manager.

2637
02:30:43,660 --> 02:30:45,380
That is correct.

2638
02:30:45,380 --> 02:30:47,060
And I also was a visitor.

2639
02:30:47,060 --> 02:30:49,860
So I was a technical leader.

2640
02:30:49,860 --> 02:30:53,220
If you're at Intel, to the point,

2641
02:30:53,220 --> 02:30:57,180
there's a title called principal engineer, senior principal

2642
02:30:57,180 --> 02:31:00,060
engineer, Intel fellow.

2643
02:31:01,020 --> 02:31:03,580
The interesting twist with that is

2644
02:31:03,580 --> 02:31:06,220
you're not promoted by the company or your manager.

2645
02:31:06,220 --> 02:31:11,860
You're promoted by your peers, which is

2646
02:31:11,860 --> 02:31:14,780
different than a lot of companies.

2647
02:31:14,780 --> 02:31:18,100
So it turns out that peers felt strong enough

2648
02:31:18,100 --> 02:31:21,940
about my technical ability to get me a senior principal

2649
02:31:21,940 --> 02:31:22,940
engineer.

2650
02:31:22,940 --> 02:31:24,940
As a senior director, you're usually

2651
02:31:24,940 --> 02:31:29,740
right under the next step as a vice president,

2652
02:31:29,780 --> 02:31:31,020
which is the same at NVIDIA.

2653
02:31:31,020 --> 02:31:33,660
My next step would be vice president there,

2654
02:31:33,660 --> 02:31:36,780
which, of course, it's narrow.

2655
02:31:36,780 --> 02:31:46,780
Anyway, to answer your question, I got concerned.

2656
02:31:46,780 --> 02:31:49,100
Sort of answer it the same way I told you

2657
02:31:49,100 --> 02:31:51,460
what I liked about NVIDIA.

2658
02:31:51,460 --> 02:31:57,420
I was concerned that the Intel culture I was used to

2659
02:31:57,420 --> 02:32:02,860
didn't go away, but was degrading, was degraded.

2660
02:32:02,860 --> 02:32:12,340
I tried in my role to enable it to come back better and work

2661
02:32:12,340 --> 02:32:12,820
on that.

2662
02:32:12,820 --> 02:32:14,500
I felt that was part of my role.

2663
02:32:14,500 --> 02:32:19,620
But I ran into enough challenges.

2664
02:32:19,620 --> 02:32:23,060
And at the stage in my career where

2665
02:32:23,060 --> 02:32:28,580
I want to do what I said, which is things that actually

2666
02:32:28,580 --> 02:32:36,460
impact a large amount of human beings on the planet,

2667
02:32:36,460 --> 02:32:39,700
one more time, one last time, if you will.

2668
02:32:39,700 --> 02:32:43,980
I am at the towards the end of my career.

2669
02:32:43,980 --> 02:32:48,220
But certainly, I don't plan to hop in two years.

2670
02:32:48,260 --> 02:32:52,100
But the bottom line is the culture

2671
02:32:52,100 --> 02:32:55,500
that NVIDIA presented when I started talking to them

2672
02:32:55,500 --> 02:33:02,780
versus the challenges, I'll say, in the traditional Intel

2673
02:33:02,780 --> 02:33:06,660
culture, which were understandable.

2674
02:33:06,660 --> 02:33:12,220
But in this stage of my career with the time I have left,

2675
02:33:12,220 --> 02:33:15,180
I wanted to spend less time trying to figure out

2676
02:33:15,180 --> 02:33:20,340
how to fix or recover the Intel culture, which

2677
02:33:20,340 --> 02:33:23,940
I think will recover.

2678
02:33:23,940 --> 02:33:28,860
NVIDIA seemed, at least so far, to be really committed

2679
02:33:28,860 --> 02:33:31,660
to what they're doing.

2680
02:33:31,660 --> 02:33:35,860
So their mission statement and their cultural values

2681
02:33:35,860 --> 02:33:39,180
is what attracted me.

2682
02:33:39,180 --> 02:33:44,060
And it wasn't that easy because I had, I would say,

2683
02:33:44,060 --> 02:33:47,580
I actually verbally said, two and a half to three years ago,

2684
02:33:47,580 --> 02:33:50,380
I had the best job in the industry.

2685
02:33:50,380 --> 02:33:58,540
But that, and then the other thing NVIDIA did

2686
02:33:58,540 --> 02:34:00,580
was be honest with me.

2687
02:34:00,580 --> 02:34:04,500
And they said, you can't do everything you were doing.

2688
02:34:04,500 --> 02:34:09,420
So they said to James Osborne, what do you want to do?

2689
02:34:09,420 --> 02:34:13,140
We're going to hire you no matter what.

2690
02:34:14,140 --> 02:34:15,620
What would you like to do?

2691
02:34:15,620 --> 02:34:17,740
You can be a leader in ray tracing.

2692
02:34:17,740 --> 02:34:19,340
You can do this, do this.

2693
02:34:19,340 --> 02:34:27,580
So I chose the high-performance computing as the thing

2694
02:34:27,580 --> 02:34:28,220
I could do.

2695
02:34:28,220 --> 02:34:30,580
And the beauty is, if that doesn't work out,

2696
02:34:30,580 --> 02:34:33,980
I'll go do ray tracing or other stuff.

2697
02:34:33,980 --> 02:34:36,580
And I'll get to utilize all those skills.

2698
02:34:36,580 --> 02:34:40,900
But yeah, the bottom line was, for me

2699
02:34:40,900 --> 02:34:48,940
in this stage of my career, the tide, if you will,

2700
02:34:48,940 --> 02:34:54,460
or the tide of Intel for me and the position I was in

2701
02:34:54,460 --> 02:34:57,140
and the structure and organization they had,

2702
02:34:57,140 --> 02:35:03,340
which makes way more difference to a leader, manager, director

2703
02:35:03,340 --> 02:35:07,580
level person, the actual environment you're in

2704
02:35:07,580 --> 02:35:12,180
and the willingness to allow you to achieve stuff

2705
02:35:12,180 --> 02:35:16,420
in the environment makes a huge difference to how much fun

2706
02:35:16,420 --> 02:35:17,700
you're having.

2707
02:35:17,700 --> 02:35:23,820
And so the bottom line is, I stopped having as much fun

2708
02:35:23,820 --> 02:35:24,860
as I liked.

2709
02:35:24,860 --> 02:35:31,140
And the rivers flow preventing me

2710
02:35:31,140 --> 02:35:34,660
from doing great things was there.

2711
02:35:34,660 --> 02:35:37,140
And NVIDIA said, come on over.

2712
02:35:37,140 --> 02:35:41,100
We're going to let you do great things.

2713
02:35:41,100 --> 02:35:41,740
Good question.

2714
02:35:41,740 --> 02:35:42,820
I saw you had a question.

2715
02:35:42,820 --> 02:35:45,380
So maybe knock off if there's a quick answer.

2716
02:35:45,380 --> 02:35:46,620
Yeah.

2717
02:35:46,620 --> 02:35:48,900
There's never a quick answer.

2718
02:35:48,900 --> 02:35:51,740
Just something that keeps, I feel

2719
02:35:51,740 --> 02:35:54,660
I keep getting at that during all my interviews.

2720
02:35:54,660 --> 02:35:59,100
So it feels like sometimes the interviewer is trying to,

2721
02:35:59,100 --> 02:36:02,540
is expecting a very specific word for something.

2722
02:36:02,540 --> 02:36:04,220
And he's trying to lead you to it.

2723
02:36:04,740 --> 02:36:08,140
I feel like I end up explaining everything around it

2724
02:36:08,140 --> 02:36:09,740
and not catch that word.

2725
02:36:09,740 --> 02:36:11,860
And then when the interviewer points out that word,

2726
02:36:11,860 --> 02:36:12,700
I'm like, of course.

2727
02:36:12,700 --> 02:36:14,300
I mean, I knew about it.

2728
02:36:14,300 --> 02:36:15,980
That's what I meant.

2729
02:36:15,980 --> 02:36:17,260
I knew everything about this.

2730
02:36:21,060 --> 02:36:22,620
You know what?

2731
02:36:22,620 --> 02:36:26,540
I'll say that was a good interviewer, actually,

2732
02:36:26,540 --> 02:36:27,340
is what I'll say.

2733
02:36:27,340 --> 02:36:29,860
You felt frustrated, but the interviewer

2734
02:36:29,860 --> 02:36:32,020
didn't give up on you.

2735
02:36:32,060 --> 02:36:34,820
Now, maybe you didn't get the job.

2736
02:36:34,820 --> 02:36:35,700
Maybe you're waiting.

2737
02:36:35,700 --> 02:36:37,900
Maybe you think that wasn't a big deal or whatever.

2738
02:36:37,900 --> 02:36:39,540
I definitely felt that way.

2739
02:36:39,540 --> 02:36:41,820
Yeah.

2740
02:36:41,820 --> 02:36:43,660
That may have been.

2741
02:36:43,660 --> 02:36:53,580
It's usually a collective set of probably miscommunication.

2742
02:36:53,580 --> 02:36:58,700
So the issue is a miscommunication

2743
02:36:58,700 --> 02:37:04,300
with the wrong, right person, whatever it is, human beings.

2744
02:37:04,300 --> 02:37:06,100
Was your interview virtual?

2745
02:37:06,100 --> 02:37:07,060
Yes, it was.

2746
02:37:07,060 --> 02:37:11,980
I was trying to make sure that I'm asking enough questions

2747
02:37:11,980 --> 02:37:15,780
so that I'm trying to get to the answer.

2748
02:37:15,780 --> 02:37:17,620
I guess that's the reason.

2749
02:37:17,620 --> 02:37:20,420
I've done tons of virtual interviews.

2750
02:37:20,420 --> 02:37:27,180
And unfortunately, the lack of direct body language

2751
02:37:28,180 --> 02:37:33,340
and you trying to talk to me if I was up on that screen

2752
02:37:33,340 --> 02:37:35,340
would be very different than me walking right up

2753
02:37:35,340 --> 02:37:36,620
like I'm doing now, right?

2754
02:37:36,620 --> 02:37:44,620
So that is a challenge for interviewers and interviewees.

2755
02:37:44,620 --> 02:37:50,740
And the lack of that literally 3D,

2756
02:37:50,740 --> 02:37:52,260
this goes back to some of the things

2757
02:37:52,260 --> 02:37:55,380
that I personally said, whatever it is,

2758
02:37:55,420 --> 02:37:58,300
and the whole notion of the metaverse and everything

2759
02:37:58,300 --> 02:38:04,580
is people like realism better than they like a flat screen

2760
02:38:04,580 --> 02:38:06,380
or whatever.

2761
02:38:06,380 --> 02:38:08,820
And that is true.

2762
02:38:08,820 --> 02:38:16,940
And your ability to fully communicate with,

2763
02:38:16,940 --> 02:38:20,740
even if you're gesturing and everything, whatever it is,

2764
02:38:20,740 --> 02:38:22,060
they don't see your torso move.

2765
02:38:22,060 --> 02:38:24,620
They don't sense all that stuff.

2766
02:38:24,620 --> 02:38:29,340
And so communication is not terrible.

2767
02:38:29,340 --> 02:38:32,780
It's 10% diminished, that 10% diminished difference.

2768
02:38:32,780 --> 02:38:37,260
So I would simply chalk it up to you're a skilled person.

2769
02:38:37,260 --> 02:38:39,860
You're going to do great.

2770
02:38:39,860 --> 02:38:42,860
You will have bumps in the road in communication,

2771
02:38:42,860 --> 02:38:44,980
personally or not personally, because you're still

2772
02:38:44,980 --> 02:38:47,700
a little bit harder virtually, to be honest.

2773
02:38:47,700 --> 02:38:54,340
And I applaud the interviewer for drawing it or attempting

2774
02:38:54,340 --> 02:38:55,700
to draw it out of you.

2775
02:38:59,780 --> 02:39:03,140
At the same time, if you literally said what it was

2776
02:39:03,140 --> 02:39:08,180
and you didn't connect the dictionary term to it,

2777
02:39:08,180 --> 02:39:09,180
I wasn't there.

2778
02:39:09,180 --> 02:39:11,740
So it really would depend on body language and stuff.

2779
02:39:11,740 --> 02:39:14,820
But it's a little bit unfair.

2780
02:39:14,820 --> 02:39:20,100
But life and interviews are not fair.

2781
02:39:20,100 --> 02:39:23,100
And so don't worry about it.

2782
02:39:23,100 --> 02:39:25,020
Let it go.

2783
02:39:25,020 --> 02:39:25,860
Let it go.

2784
02:39:25,860 --> 02:39:26,900
You're going to do great.

2785
02:39:26,900 --> 02:39:28,100
I can tell.

2786
02:39:28,100 --> 02:39:32,700
So just be confident.

2787
02:39:32,700 --> 02:39:33,700
Be honest.

2788
02:39:33,700 --> 02:39:35,340
I don't know what word you're going for.

2789
02:39:35,340 --> 02:39:35,940
I'm sorry.

2790
02:39:35,940 --> 02:39:39,740
And obviously, if they're poking at you,

2791
02:39:39,740 --> 02:39:41,820
you don't want to turn them off either.

2792
02:39:41,820 --> 02:39:44,340
You don't want to just say, no, I'm not going to answer it.

2793
02:39:44,340 --> 02:39:49,700
But just say, hey, we didn't have the right communication

2794
02:39:49,700 --> 02:39:50,740
style with each other.

2795
02:39:53,420 --> 02:39:54,180
It is what it is.

2796
02:39:54,180 --> 02:39:57,140
And unfortunately, you can't talk to the 100 people

2797
02:39:57,140 --> 02:39:58,860
you're going to work with at the company.

2798
02:39:58,860 --> 02:40:01,740
You're talking to the three of us.

2799
02:40:01,740 --> 02:40:02,660
Hopefully, that helps.

2800
02:40:02,660 --> 02:40:03,660
So this was great.

2801
02:40:03,660 --> 02:40:08,220
Thank you, everybody, for your attention.

2802
02:40:08,220 --> 02:40:13,580
And really great to meet you all.

2803
02:40:13,580 --> 02:40:14,620
I didn't get it.

2804
02:40:14,620 --> 02:40:16,740
I actually pulled this together relatively quickly.

2805
02:40:16,740 --> 02:40:18,020
I guess you couldn't tell that.

2806
02:40:18,860 --> 02:40:21,860
Right there.

2807
02:40:21,860 --> 02:40:29,020
So on Twitter, I am at Jim Jeffers 3D.

2808
02:40:29,020 --> 02:40:34,380
I actually changed that recently because I wanted a new name,

2809
02:40:34,380 --> 02:40:38,020
because mine was so associated with Intel.

2810
02:40:38,020 --> 02:40:42,460
And then so I'm Jim Jeffers 3D there.

2811
02:40:42,460 --> 02:40:46,460
I typically go by Jim, but tons of people

2812
02:40:46,460 --> 02:40:49,260
connect with me as James L. Jeffers.

2813
02:40:49,260 --> 02:40:51,380
And that is what my LinkedIn is.

2814
02:40:51,380 --> 02:40:58,220
So linkedin.com slash in slash James L. Jeffers

2815
02:40:58,220 --> 02:41:03,060
is another way to contact and communicate with me.

2816
02:41:03,060 --> 02:41:07,660
And I really appreciate all your questions and your attention.

2817
02:41:07,660 --> 02:41:10,020
And good luck with everything, and if you

2818
02:41:10,020 --> 02:41:12,260
think I can help you.

2819
02:41:12,260 --> 02:41:19,980
One other advertisement, through a totally different means,

2820
02:41:19,980 --> 02:41:27,620
I will be back next Wednesday at the local SIGGRAPH

2821
02:41:27,620 --> 02:41:38,500
undergraduate run chapter to either redo or tweak this talk.

2822
02:41:38,500 --> 02:41:40,100
So you don't necessarily have to go.

2823
02:41:40,140 --> 02:41:46,220
But if you're part of the local UPenn driven SIGGRAPH chapter,

2824
02:41:46,220 --> 02:41:49,820
I've been invited to speak there through a totally different

2825
02:41:49,820 --> 02:41:53,220
connection, mostly an open source connection in that case.

2826
02:41:53,220 --> 02:41:55,860
So it just was a coincidence.

2827
02:41:55,860 --> 02:41:59,900
But anyway, feel free to stop on by and say hi.

2828
02:41:59,900 --> 02:42:02,500
And again, great to meet you all.

2829
02:42:02,500 --> 02:42:05,700
Just before I say thanks, a quick show of hands.

2830
02:42:05,700 --> 02:42:08,500
How many of you have job offers from Inverdeer?

2831
02:42:11,500 --> 02:42:12,780
So your future colleagues.

2832
02:42:12,780 --> 02:42:14,860
How many might have job offers from Inverdeer?

2833
02:42:14,860 --> 02:42:18,940
I only wanted to check future colleagues of yours.

2834
02:42:18,940 --> 02:42:20,900
Yeah.

2835
02:42:20,900 --> 02:42:25,580
I don't know what I'm doing right now, to be truly honest.

2836
02:42:25,580 --> 02:42:30,300
So even somebody as long term in everything I've done,

2837
02:42:30,300 --> 02:42:33,660
I've got my year or two that I've got to put under my belt.

2838
02:42:33,660 --> 02:42:35,940
Hopefully, I'm at least contributing.

2839
02:42:35,940 --> 02:42:40,020
Maybe not making an ROI in the next three months or so.

2840
02:42:40,020 --> 02:42:43,980
Maybe after the holidays and to Q1.

2841
02:42:43,980 --> 02:42:49,860
But yeah, feel free to reach out if I

2842
02:42:49,860 --> 02:42:53,460
can connect you with the right people, the right interest.

2843
02:42:53,460 --> 02:42:55,460
I'll show you info on our class board

2844
02:42:55,460 --> 02:42:57,380
so that anybody who has interview advice

2845
02:42:57,380 --> 02:43:00,180
or wants to reach out for a reference.

2846
02:43:00,180 --> 02:43:00,700
Say hi.

2847
02:43:00,700 --> 02:43:02,460
I will do my best.

2848
02:43:02,460 --> 02:43:05,380
Interestingly, I am not the only Intel person

2849
02:43:05,380 --> 02:43:07,980
who has joined Inverdeer in the last three years,

2850
02:43:07,980 --> 02:43:12,380
including four from my own team, left,

2851
02:43:12,380 --> 02:43:16,500
as much as I've been to come to stay.

2852
02:43:16,500 --> 02:43:18,940
And other people, and of course, I

2853
02:43:18,940 --> 02:43:22,180
have a sort of an industry presence.

2854
02:43:22,180 --> 02:43:25,700
But I'll try to help you any way I can.

2855
02:43:25,700 --> 02:43:28,780
I do happen to be, from what I can tell,

2856
02:43:28,780 --> 02:43:32,380
highly related to what they call an Inverdeer dev tech.

2857
02:43:32,380 --> 02:43:36,860
That is not the people who make the actual products.

2858
02:43:36,860 --> 02:43:39,580
It is the Inverdeer engineering team

2859
02:43:39,580 --> 02:43:43,580
that works with third party companies and customers

2860
02:43:43,580 --> 02:43:48,700
to enable CUDA, enable Omniverse, enable that stuff.

2861
02:43:48,700 --> 02:43:53,700
It's a pretty cool but customer facing job.

2862
02:43:53,700 --> 02:43:56,020
Sometimes they like you to have a little more experience,

2863
02:43:56,020 --> 02:43:58,340
but sometimes it's in a team atmosphere.

2864
02:43:58,340 --> 02:44:03,820
So while I actually know quite well

2865
02:44:03,820 --> 02:44:06,940
the leader of ray tracing named Steve Parker

2866
02:44:06,940 --> 02:44:13,500
and several people in that org, yeah, to the extent I can,

2867
02:44:13,500 --> 02:44:17,660
I will at least help you connect the dots.

2868
02:44:17,660 --> 02:44:21,220
And like I said, anything I do, a question

2869
02:44:21,220 --> 02:44:23,980
you forgot to ask or something occurs to you

2870
02:44:23,980 --> 02:44:28,060
and you think I can help, book up with me on LinkedIn

2871
02:44:28,580 --> 02:44:31,700
or whatever and direct message me or something.

2872
02:44:31,700 --> 02:44:32,220
All right.

2873
02:44:32,220 --> 02:44:33,300
With that, thank you, Jim.

2874
02:44:33,300 --> 02:44:34,300
Thank you for your time.

2875
02:44:34,300 --> 02:44:35,100
Thanks, everyone.

2876
02:44:35,100 --> 02:44:35,700
Thank you.

2877
02:44:35,700 --> 02:44:36,300
Thank you.

2878
02:44:36,300 --> 02:44:37,860
Thank you.
