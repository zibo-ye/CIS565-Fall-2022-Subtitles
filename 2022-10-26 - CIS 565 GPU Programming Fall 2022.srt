1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's make sure I'm not on mute, okay.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,440
All right, so with today's class,

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,840
we essentially move into what I'll call loosely

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,640
the last trimester of our semester.

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,920
So for me, when I'm teaching this class,

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,920
the first trimester is getting you guys up to speed

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,160
on CUDA, leading up to project three.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,840
Then I would say the second trimester

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,440
is project three and project four and project five.

10
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,760
You've got that experience

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,600
with hands-on computer GPU programming.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,140
And now I'm only like teaching that one stuff

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,440
and the guest lectures I've started.

14
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,120
And now we go into the final trimester,

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,040
which is probably the most exciting part for me.

16
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,360
So in this class today, what I'm gonna do

17
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,700
is I'm gonna be sharing really more

18
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,820
about the motivation behind final projects,

19
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,260
what to expect, what the grading looks like,

20
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,220
because that matters to you.

21
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,540
For me, it's more about the work

22
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,100
and what you guys should be looking for

23
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,980
when doing these projects.

24
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,100
And feel free to stop me at any time.

25
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,420
I'm more than happy to take any questions at any point.

26
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,860
I know I don't need to say that again,

27
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,220
given that we've been in probably 20 lectures by now,

28
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,460
but feel free to pause me at any time and ask questions.

29
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,380
Why are you not working?

30
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,980
All right, that should work.

31
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,220
Okay, so the first thing is what are final projects?

32
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,180
What is expected of final projects?

33
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:46,500
Final projects in 5.635 are gonna be large,

34
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,140
and I really mean large, path traces, not large.

35
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,180
GPU programming projects of your choice, okay?

36
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,140
They can be graphics, computing, machine learning,

37
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,140
whatever you may want,

38
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:03,740
as long as they have a GPU component in them.

39
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,420
And this doesn't mean you're writing CUDA necessarily.

40
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,140
It could be using any type of API that you want.

41
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,140
It will be two to three times harder

42
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,220
than the hardest project,

43
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,340
or it is expected to be two to three times harder

44
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,260
than your hardest project, which is generally path tracer.

45
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,740
But you also get to work in teams,

46
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,740
so it's not like you're necessarily overworking yourselves.

47
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,060
The best projects require about 100 hours of time commitment

48
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,940
based on the feedback we've received.

49
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,700
But if you think about it, it's not 100 hours in a week,

50
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,580
it's 100 hours spread over four and a half,

51
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,700
I think it's five weeks at this point.

52
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,140
So you're giving 20 hours a week,

53
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,500
which is probably generally what you've given

54
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,260
to this class for the most part.

55
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,700
Okay, so final projects themselves,

56
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,460
must be some combination of this.

57
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,580
It can't be just one, it doesn't have to be all of them,

58
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,340
but it has to be some combination of this.

59
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,420
It needs to serve a real need in the community.

60
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,140
And I'll keep giving examples, okay?

61
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,300
A need in a community, for example,

62
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,660
is you do an amazing project for WebGPU

63
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,740
that has driver adoption.

64
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,180
You make amazing samples for WebGPU,

65
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,940
and that's now the de facto,

66
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,220
okay, if you want to learn WebGPU, you go to that project.

67
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,580
So that's like serving a need in the community.

68
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,140
Exploring a new API.

69
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,580
CUDA at this point is not a new API to you, okay?

70
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,780
You may want to explore metal, right?

71
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,620
You may want to explore one API from Intel.

72
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,380
So that again is encouraged.

73
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,700
It can be recent research,

74
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,620
like graph papers, graph Asia papers,

75
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,260
high performance graphics,

76
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,020
you know, anything that you find interesting.

77
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,020
It could be extensions to existing work.

78
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,380
This could be, you know,

79
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,340
improving the performance significantly,

80
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,860
or adding, combining two different techniques

81
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,700
to bring something new to the table.

82
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,300
Or it could be something completely original.

83
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,180
You have an idea that you're coming up with,

84
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,020
and you're like,

85
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,100
hey, I'm interested in the super niche thing.

86
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,940
Maybe you're researching that in your PhD,

87
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,340
but you want to test it out on the GPU in the first,

88
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,500
more than happy to accept that as well.

89
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,860
So some combination of all these, okay?

90
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,900
We're not saying it has to be two out of five,

91
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,140
and we're not saying it has to be three out of five.

92
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,860
It depends on what your idea is,

93
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,860
that it has to pick some of these boxes,

94
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,980
and that is generally accepted.

95
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,100
Any questions on this?

96
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,100
Okay.

97
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,420
Either I'm doing a really good job,

98
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,460
or I've scared all of you already.

99
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,220
No questions?

100
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,660
Okay.

101
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,580
So, like I said,

102
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,740
you'd be working in teams of two or three.

103
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,580
That's the recommended approach, okay?

104
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,700
All of you will receive the same grade, okay?

105
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,220
Teams of four, I've never had a team of four,

106
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,900
but if you are trying to do a team of four,

107
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,660
the level of work that is required is extremely high.

108
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,500
And yes, please get pre-approval.

109
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,100
If you're trying to do something alone,

110
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,940
that is discouraged,

111
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,860
because the amount of work you're able to do

112
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,660
as a single person team is not gonna be as big

113
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,460
as something that two to three people will do.

114
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,820
That's not necessarily a detriment to you,

115
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,220
like the amount of work you might put together

116
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,740
is probably equivalent,

117
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,220
but the impact you're creating as a single contributor

118
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,940
versus working in a team of two or three

119
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,940
is gonna be a lot less,

120
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,060
because you're gonna be putting in less time.

121
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,300
So, it is in your favor,

122
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,620
it is for your betterment that you work

123
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,220
in a team of people.

124
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,100
So, if you absolutely want to work alone

125
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,300
and you have good reason for it,

126
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,860
you can get pre-approval,

127
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,780
but it's not guaranteed that we will approve it, okay?

128
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,780
So, if you're thinking about it,

129
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,620
please reach out early,

130
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,700
don't wait until last minute to ask,

131
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,620
hey, can I work alone kind of thing, okay?

132
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,580
Any questions here?

133
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:15,860
No?

134
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,500
I do not control how you form things at all,

135
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,660
it's completely up to you.

136
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,020
If you want to use that discussions

137
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,940
that's absolutely available,

138
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,020
you can be like, hey, I have these ideas,

139
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,740
if is anybody interested, please do that.

140
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,300
You can use private messages to reply if you want,

141
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,460
I think that's enabled.

142
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:37,460
But yeah, I don't play any part in how teams are formed,

143
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,860
because I don't want to get into those dynamics.

144
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,100
Any other questions?

145
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:45,900
Okay.

146
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,020
The other thing you can do to form teams is,

147
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,060
I'll come to it in a bit,

148
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,460
but as teams are being formed,

149
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,300
they're gonna put their names on a spreadsheet.

150
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,780
If you are interested in an idea,

151
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,700
you can be like, hey, can I join your team as well?

152
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,540
That's fine with me,

153
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,140
but it's up to the team itself to say yes or no,

154
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,620
that's not under my control.

155
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,380
Okay.

156
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,060
So, other guidelines, use GitHub, I think,

157
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,220
that's generally worked well for everybody.

158
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,380
You may use private repos,

159
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,460
but it's not encouraged or required.

160
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,580
Again, like I said before,

161
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,740
the programming language, graphics, whatever you want,

162
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,820
the platforms completely up to you.

163
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,660
Okay.

164
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,660
Again, I'm giving you the freedom to pick your interests,

165
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,860
but I'm expecting good work out of it.

166
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,700
Okay.

167
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,260
I want you to be able to pay that back

168
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,940
for what you are interested in.

169
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,580
To be completely honest,

170
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,500
this is work you may be doing in the class,

171
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,660
but you're not doing it for me,

172
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,380
you're doing it for yourselves, right?

173
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:54,380
This is like your highlight of your time at Penn almost,

174
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,620
and you have the freedom to do pretty much anything you want

175
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,820
as long as it's related to the GPU.

176
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,780
So, you get to pick what you want.

177
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,660
Like other projects,

178
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,700
you are allowed to use existing libraries.

179
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,580
So, for example,

180
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,340
you use TinyOBJ or TinyGLTF for PathTracer.

181
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,300
You can use similar libraries here as well.

182
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,220
The key thing is that they must not be solving the problem

183
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,260
that you are trying to implement itself.

184
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,100
Like in PathTracer,

185
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,460
you are trying to implement a PathTracer,

186
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,660
you're not trying to read an OBJ,

187
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,540
so it's fine to use a library for that.

188
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,140
So, in similar way, that is fine here as well.

189
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,300
So, any questions so far?

190
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,940
No?

191
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,180
Okay.

192
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,180
So, here's what the tentative schedule looks like, okay?

193
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,020
And pay attention here.

194
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,860
So, what you're going to get started with

195
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,260
is what I'll call a pitch.

196
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:57,900
And I will use here in final projects

197
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,580
are essentially what people do in the industry, okay?

198
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,020
If you want to,

199
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,380
if you are looking for something new that can change

200
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,620
how your company operates in the future

201
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,180
or build a new product,

202
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,860
you are going to have to write a document or some idea,

203
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,580
formulate your idea and communicate that to your manager

204
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,060
so that you get approval.

205
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,460
That's gonna be your pitch, okay?

206
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,380
You're gonna be doing that.

207
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,900
So, that's you on, I believe it's a Sunday, November 6th.

208
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,620
On November 7th, you'll pitch it.

209
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,180
You'll pitch it to me and a few others, including the TAs,

210
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,260
about why you want to do this idea,

211
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:37,940
you know, what's important,

212
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,460
what are the different components of it

213
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,500
and why it should be accepted as a final project.

214
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,140
November 12th is shadow team selection.

215
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,940
And I'll come back to shadow teams in a little bit.

216
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,620
And then we have three milestones

217
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,260
before the final presentations.

218
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,140
These milestones are key checkpoints

219
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,980
for when you will show your progress in the class

220
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,060
with demos, videos, whatever it might be.

221
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,660
So, these will be presentations,

222
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,820
but generally very short.

223
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,780
And I'll give you guidelines for these as well.

224
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,980
So, we'll have three of those on November 16th,

225
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,340
November 28th, which is after Thanksgiving

226
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,460
and December 5th.

227
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,740
December 11th, I didn't change the year, did I?

228
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,780
I should be changing the year.

229
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,620
I changed the dates.

230
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,820
I didn't change the year.

231
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:30,380
December 11th will be your court submission, essentially.

232
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,740
That's when your code is done, your readme is done.

233
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,540
You don't touch GitHub after that.

234
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,780
On December 12th at 4 p.m.,

235
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,260
that's when your final presentations are due.

236
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,500
That means your slides are due at that time.

237
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,540
And then at 5.30 approximately

238
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,140
is when we'll do the presentations themselves.

239
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,420
And these will be live.

240
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,660
And I'll share details on each one of these with you.

241
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,860
But any questions on this other than the year?

242
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,900
Does anyone have any feedback?

243
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,180
We'll do, we'll ask you to make changes

244
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,140
and give you feedback.

245
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,060
And depending on how much changes are required,

246
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,580
you may either be able to just resubmit the document

247
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,700
with those edits,

248
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,380
or if it's completely out of the park

249
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,900
and we need you to submit a new idea,

250
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,340
then we'll do a follow-up that Wednesday.

251
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,780
Edward?

252
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:29,540
Are the pitches with pre-formed groups

253
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:33,020
or do you just do that with a new idea?

254
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,540
No, you'd be pitching as a team.

255
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,460
You'd be forming your team and then pitching it as a team.

256
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,740
Yes.

257
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,740
So essentially you don't touch GitHub after this.

258
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,580
And no late days.

259
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,780
If you save late days, use it for final project

260
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,820
or project five, use all the extra credit.

261
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,420
You don't have any late days for final projects.

262
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,460
Any other questions here?

263
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:01,980
No?

264
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:06,980
We already have teams for final project pitching as well.

265
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,140
I'll get to that.

266
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,180
So this is just an overview.

267
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,100
I'll confirm all of,

268
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,060
I'll get into the details of all of this.

269
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,180
But any questions here on an overview?

270
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,580
Okay.

271
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,420
All right.

272
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,940
So final project pitches itself.

273
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,260
The first thing you're gonna want to do

274
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,220
because it's first come first serve

275
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,300
is put your team name in this document.

276
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,940
It's an Excel spreadsheet.

277
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,540
I'll bring it up here so that all of you can see it.

278
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,140
So what you're gonna do for the first thing,

279
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,500
like even right away,

280
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,540
if you know who your team is,

281
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,740
who you want to be teaming up with, put your names.

282
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,820
You don't even have to put your idea.

283
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,180
Just put your name on the time that works for you.

284
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,340
And the time may change.

285
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,980
Like if we get enough teams,

286
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,100
we may have to start around like 4.30 or something.

287
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,820
So the time may change,

288
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,980
but essentially put your names on there

289
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,500
because if once a team puts their name,

290
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,060
that's their slot, okay?

291
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,100
The time is essentially when you're gonna be pitching.

292
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,740
And I'll come to this in a little bit,

293
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:18,260
but essentially your team is gonna come,

294
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,500
you're gonna sit down.

295
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,380
We would have already read your pitch,

296
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,860
but we'll ask a few questions.

297
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,940
We'll ask for your motivation and stuff.

298
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,820
And it's about 20 minutes per team.

299
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,900
So yeah, that's...

300
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,660
And then once you put your names there

301
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,420
and you're working through your ideas,

302
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,420
eventually you're gonna create a pitch document,

303
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,820
which again, I'll get to,

304
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,660
and you're gonna link it here in this column, okay?

305
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,420
So those are the first two steps you need to do

306
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,420
before the pitches.

307
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,540
Any questions on this?

308
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:55,500
Okay, so again, we'll have a special office hours

309
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,700
next Monday to help answer your questions and stuff.

310
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,100
You don't come with like 50 ideas

311
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:10,340
because I almost never say,

312
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,980
hey, do this exact project.

313
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,100
I will say, if you are interested in this,

314
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,540
here are the things to think about.

315
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,220
And if you're interested, go forward.

316
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,540
I'm gonna give you guidelines

317
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,540
around how to think about these projects, okay?

318
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,420
So come with like three at most.

319
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,420
If you're coming with five,

320
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,340
then you need to narrow it down yourself first

321
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:35,900
about why you want to do all of the five, okay?

322
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,300
Narrow it down to two to three,

323
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,580
and then we can have more discussions.

324
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,140
The pitches themselves,

325
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,500
this year is gonna be really special

326
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,180
because I'm gonna be hosting these

327
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,100
in the brand new CGU office.

328
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,340
And I say brand new

329
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:55,860
because we are literally gonna move into it on Tuesday.

330
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,900
So we're gonna move into it Tuesday

331
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,340
and the following Monday,

332
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,740
you guys are gonna come in there.

333
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,300
And I'm doing this because I wanna give a feel for,

334
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,700
again, the motivation is to work,

335
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,620
how it's like to work in the industry.

336
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,260
I've said that from day one.

337
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,060
I wanna give you guys that feel.

338
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,260
And we'll make a great environment that we'll have pizza,

339
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,220
we'll have some drinks, cookies, and those kinds of things.

340
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,660
You're free to come at any time,

341
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:26,260
depending on like your pitch time may be one thing,

342
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,020
but you are free to come in at any time.

343
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,860
You're free to hang out, eat.

344
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,580
And we also have a really good arcade,

345
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:36,580
including an NES, a Nintendo Switch, a PlayStation 1,

346
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,100
a Super NES, and a bunch of arcade games there.

347
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,500
I think that's Ridge Racer, Pac-Man,

348
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,420
and a digital Marvel.

349
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,260
You can play Spider-Man pinball and all that.

350
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,020
It's brilliant, trust me.

351
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,100
That's where I'm coming from today.

352
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,900
So yeah, we'll be doing these.

353
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,020
You are free to take whatever transport you want.

354
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:01,660
I'm not taking care of that, but it's not too bad.

355
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,420
You take the subway from like 34th street to 5th street,

356
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,540
and then it's a block from there.

357
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,860
So it's pretty convenient.

358
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,740
Any questions on this?

359
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,820
No?

360
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,700
How many of you are excited to play that arcade?

361
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,740
All right, good.

362
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,300
Come early.

363
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,420
I'm telling you, you can come early.

364
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,100
Don't make it that tight.

365
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,780
That's my recommendation.

366
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,500
You are free to select those times.

367
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,900
I'm not giving you those times.

368
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,140
You're free to select those times.

369
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,500
So if you have a class that ends at 5 p.m.,

370
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,940
don't pick the 5.30 slot.

371
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,380
Pick the 6 p.m. slot.

372
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,660
So that's my recommendation around that.

373
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,060
Any questions?

374
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,940
Okay.

375
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,700
All right, grading which I know all of you care about.

376
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,900
Your project, this final project is worth 50%

377
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,420
of all the grade in the class.

378
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,780
Imagine all the work you've done so far.

379
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:09,700
Voids, stream compaction, path tracer,

380
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,700
denoiser, and now you're either doing Vulkan or WebGL.

381
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,700
You've done all of that work and that is only worth half.

382
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,820
This is what the other half.

383
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,020
It may not be as much work

384
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,540
as all of those five projects combined,

385
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:26,220
but it's still like very, very important, okay?

386
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,620
So that's 50% of your grade.

387
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,340
It'll be divided into four parts.

388
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,140
Each of the milestones will account for,

389
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,780
or five parts technically.

390
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,340
Each of the progress you make,

391
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,820
that is the core progress you make in the milestones

392
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,100
will be about 20% each, okay?

393
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,580
And then the final submission that you do is additional 20%.

394
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,340
And then the presentations that you give

395
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,740
for each of the milestones and the final presentation

396
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,140
will be worth 20%.

397
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,860
So it's not just the code that counts,

398
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,580
which I've always said, you know,

399
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,380
in your projects it's the readme,

400
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,580
here it's gonna be the presentations.

401
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,620
Those are going to count for 20% too.

402
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,620
Any questions around this grading?

403
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,220
And a reminder that everybody,

404
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,420
the entire team receives the same grade.

405
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,100
If any of you have a questions about,

406
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,980
hey, my class disappeared and I don't know what to do.

407
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,260
Don't wait till the final submission,

408
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,620
tell me when that happens, okay?

409
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,380
So that we can help resolve it.

410
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,980
Ideally that situation never,

411
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,420
if it happens, you know, please communicate early.

412
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,980
Don't wait for the last minute.

413
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,140
Any other questions here?

414
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,980
Okay.

415
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,580
Nobody cares about grades anymore?

416
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,020
Okay.

417
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,260
That's a good thing.

418
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,100
All right.

419
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,380
So the project pitches themselves.

420
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,300
Okay, here's the do's and don'ts.

421
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,260
You want to either write a one page document

422
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,780
or five slides.

423
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,660
It is up to you.

424
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,620
You can do a Google Doc,

425
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,140
you can do Word,

426
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,980
or you can do PowerPoint or Google Sites.

427
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,020
Completely up to you.

428
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,380
Submit a PDF for all it's worth.

429
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,940
Conciseness is best, you know?

430
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,900
Give the key information that's useful.

431
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,620
Have clear goals and outcomes.

432
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,620
Talk about why you want to do the project,

433
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,780
what is expected out of the project,

434
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,500
what each of the milestones should be

435
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,100
and what you wish to accomplish.

436
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,060
Include any programming languages,

437
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,540
APIs, platforms that you wish to use,

438
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,580
game engines that you might want to use,

439
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,900
references to any papers, inspiration,

440
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,260
those kinds of things,

441
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,820
and any third party code.

442
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,300
Now, what you shouldn't do,

443
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,420
don't include math equations.

444
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,100
I won't understand them, nobody will understand them.

445
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:41,940
Okay?

446
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,300
Don't include it, they're not useful.

447
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,220
Don't exceed two pages and five slides

448
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,660
and or five slides.

449
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,540
Because again, if it's more than two pages,

450
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,620
I'm not going to read.

451
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,900
That means you're not writing it concisely.

452
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,220
You can,

453
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,660
don't bring repeat ideas.

454
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:07,660
For example, we had a WebGPU based GLTF viewer last year.

455
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,380
Don't do the same thing.

456
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,220
That's done.

457
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,180
You're not doing anything new.

458
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,580
You're a year ahead.

459
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,820
You should be moving the class forward.

460
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,940
Okay?

461
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,620
And lastly, don't come unprepared.

462
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,660
Understand why you want to do this project.

463
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,060
I'm telling you the questions that I'm going to ask.

464
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,660
If you come unprepared, then it's going to look sloppy

465
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,340
and I'm going to be like, okay, go rework that.

466
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,100
And while you're reworking it

467
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,260
between the Monday and the Wednesday,

468
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,060
other teams have already gotten started on the projects.

469
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,220
So it's going to put you at a disadvantage.

470
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,460
Any questions about these pitches?

471
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,740
Wayne, any recommendations from your pitch last year?

472
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,540
Yeah.

473
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,380
If you remember.

474
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,900
Your pitch was probably one of the easy ones last year.

475
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,740
Yeah.

476
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,860
Yours, Matt's, and Ashley's.

477
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,020
Yeah.

478
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,220
The project wasn't easy.

479
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,420
The pitch was well done.

480
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,500
Wait, were you saying my project?

481
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,340
Your pitch.

482
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,780
Okay, yeah, yeah.

483
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:17,780
It was well done, yes.

484
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,780
Yeah.

485
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,740
But any recommendations you have

486
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,500
as a student who's written a pitch?

487
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:27,020
Yeah, I think that's a stupid short.

488
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,460
Say you're implementing a paper,

489
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,500
you don't really have to talk a lot about the paper,

490
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,700
but really focus on what's novel about your project.

491
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,580
I think that's the most important thing.

492
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,580
Yeah.

493
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,940
So again, I'm coming from the industry.

494
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,940
I understand things would move.

495
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,580
When I ask you to write a schedule

496
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,020
for milestone one to three on the final,

497
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,820
I am asking based on what is your expectation.

498
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:00,380
If let's say one feature as part of one of these milestones

499
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,300
is like, hey, we spend more time on this,

500
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,740
so we are not able to accomplish it, it's fine.

501
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,700
Don't worry about it.

502
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,940
I want to make sure that you understand

503
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,420
what the requirements are and how much time it takes.

504
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,500
And if I don't see that to be realistic,

505
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
I will tell you, hey, this is not realistic,

506
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,420
move these things around.

507
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,220
Again, I want to help you do amazing things, okay?

508
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,700
This is not a test, okay?

509
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,060
So be very conscious, be very pragmatic

510
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,540
about what you're taking on

511
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,780
and you're understanding the problem

512
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,420
that you want to implement.

513
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,260
And what I'm asking you to do here

514
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,780
is essentially a sanity check that you understand it

515
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,900
and I can confirm it from my side.

516
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,900
I'm not gonna understand all the problems you come up with.

517
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,740
You may come up with,

518
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,100
hey, I want to do machine learning

519
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:51,100
that understands when it'll rain in not great weather.

520
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,380
Sure, like write a machine learning algorithm.

521
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,860
Do I know much about machine learning?

522
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,700
Probably not.

523
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,860
Can I connect you with Liam

524
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,660
who knows a lot about machine learning?

525
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,500
Yes.

526
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,140
Can I connect you with industry people?

527
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,460
Absolutely.

528
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,060
But the fact is I want to make sure

529
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,580
that you understand what you're doing, okay?

530
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,540
Anything else here?

531
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,740
Yeah.

532
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,700
Are you asking about the milestone date

533
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,260
or the amount of progress to make in the milestone?

534
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,220
Again, they should be reasonably set.

535
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:33,900
Like again, if you plan to do three things in milestone two

536
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,820
and you do two and a half, fine, I don't really care.

537
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,940
You're not gonna get dark points for that.

538
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,500
Again, I live in a realistic world.

539
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,660
I see deadlines slipping every day.

540
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,020
So that's not the worst thing.

541
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,740
Now, if you come from milestone one to milestone two

542
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,700
and you're like, I haven't made any progress.

543
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,060
Yes, that is a problem, okay?

544
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,820
So I will be as reasonable as I can be.

545
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,380
I'm here to guide you,

546
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,260
but ultimately you have to do the work, okay?

547
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,980
You are free to change it if you have good reason.

548
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,980
Let's say you do milestone one and you're like,

549
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,980
hey, we did made a lot of progress,

550
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,340
but while making the progress,

551
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,900
we realized like all of these things

552
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,140
that completely throw a plan out of the window

553
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,380
and here's a new plan and you've thought about it.

554
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,300
Fine, no problem, okay?

555
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:29,540
But being able to articulate what happened

556
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,420
and what your new plan is and doing that well,

557
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,780
that is the important part.

558
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,460
Make sure you're not coming into the class

559
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,900
and saying I have no progress, okay?

560
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,540
If you're running into problems,

561
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,860
communicate that so that when we come into the milestones,

562
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,580
we know what to expect and we are just there to see,

563
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,580
okay, you've thought about it

564
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,420
and you know what the way forward is.

565
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,140
Any other questions on the pitches?

566
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,860
Okay, all right.

567
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,420
Coming to the milestone presentations,

568
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,700
this is when you're gonna be up here

569
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,540
and you're gonna talk.

570
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,660
So I'm gonna be sitting there pretty much the entire class.

571
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,340
You will have time limits, okay?

572
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,700
We will, before the presentations,

573
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,180
a few days, at least a few days before the presentations,

574
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,980
we'll tell you how many minutes you have

575
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,940
and this is gonna be generally between five and eight.

576
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,020
It's not gonna be very long.

577
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,020
You're not gonna be giving a 20 minute presentation.

578
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,820
I don't think we'd be able to sit through

579
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,260
that many presentations.

580
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:35,140
So if I say the limit is five minutes, it is five minutes.

581
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:38,140
You go over, you get doc points, okay?

582
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,260
Again, I am not looking for you to tell me

583
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,500
the entire history of your week.

584
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,980
Tell me the main points.

585
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,820
That's the key thing.

586
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,500
Show me the progress that you've made since last milestone.

587
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,140
These can be videos, images, demos, including live demos.

588
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,260
And then tell me what your goals for the next milestone are,

589
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,900
if they're consistent with your pitch

590
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,820
or you're planning to change them a little bit.

591
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,620
Again, perfectly fine.

592
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:09,140
The audience here now,

593
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,780
from when you start doing these milestones

594
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,660
is not just gonna be me and the TAs.

595
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,700
Don't look at us when you're talking.

596
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,780
You're sharing this with the entire class.

597
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:21,460
Your class is there to understand what you're doing

598
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,980
and be inspired by it, okay?

599
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,780
So the audience is all of us

600
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,900
and you wanna take that into account.

601
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,260
And then once you're done with the milestone,

602
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,260
add that presentation to your GitHub repo, okay?

603
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,540
Other do's, use social media.

604
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,980
I've seen some of you use social media, props for it.

605
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,660
I've liked it, I've shared it.

606
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,660
Use social media more and more, okay?

607
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,860
Get in touch with the authors.

608
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,060
Eric Haynes shared this before.

609
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,060
Brandon asked you to reach out if you're doing WebGPU.

610
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,100
Reach out to the authors.

611
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:59,420
They love it if people are trying to replicate their work

612
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,060
and advance their work.

613
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:04,100
None of the people whose work you will try to recreate

614
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:09,100
or advance will have even a sense of ego or jealousy

615
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,460
that, hey, why is this person doing my work?

616
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,220
No, they will in fact take pride that,

617
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,740
hey, I've done something that is inspiring other people

618
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,540
to do the same thing, okay?

619
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,740
There are presentation guides.

620
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,980
Again, this is also guides.

621
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:25,420
So please watch that and prepare for the presentations.

622
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,100
Don't come in sloppily.

623
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,980
How the quality of your presentation

624
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,380
determines that final 20% of your grade.

625
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,260
Remember that, okay?

626
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,500
I'll take questions after I do the don'ts part.

627
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,740
Now, don't.

628
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,020
Don't exceed the time.

629
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,700
Again, reiterating that happens every year.

630
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,540
Don't do it.

631
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,540
Please try not to do it.

632
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,580
Don't include code and math equations in your presentation.

633
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,500
It's not useful.

634
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,740
You're gonna be presenting for five minutes, right?

635
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,900
To read five lines of code,

636
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,700
I'm gonna take more time than that, okay?

637
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,620
Include a math equation that shows how,

638
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,500
let's say the rendering equation works.

639
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,140
You're gonna need way more time to explain

640
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,380
what the math equation is than you have time.

641
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,060
So don't include them unless there is something

642
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,060
very, very, very exceptional about it.

643
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,100
Sharing that equation is a required part

644
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,260
of explaining what happens next, okay?

645
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,740
You don't need to open Visual Studio.

646
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,020
You don't need to walk through the code.

647
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,180
You want to do demos?

648
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,740
Awesome, do demos.

649
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,580
But have it ready.

650
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,820
Compile it, have it ready.

651
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,260
Don't compile in front of it

652
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,980
because that's using up your time, okay?

653
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,460
You don't get free,

654
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,620
you don't get additional 30 seconds for compiling time.

655
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,340
That's five minutes, if I say five minutes, okay?

656
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,820
So any questions on the milestone presentations?

657
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,580
No?

658
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,540
I'm sure there'll be some.

659
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,300
Okay, I'll move on.

660
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,900
So final presentations are a bit special.

661
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,140
So you have milestone one, two, three,

662
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,660
which will be the milestone presentations.

663
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,980
Then we'll have the final presentations.

664
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,900
And they're gonna be special

665
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,740
because I'm going to invite

666
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:15,660
not just guest speakers from this year.

667
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,260
I'm gonna be inviting guest speakers from last year,

668
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,220
friends of the course,

669
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,100
and anybody who takes an interest

670
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,860
in the final projects in this class.

671
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,940
And trust me, there are a lot of people.

672
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,980
I think last year we had at least 25 people join.

673
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,980
And this is all people like Brandon Jones

674
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,300
who are joining, and Eric Haynes joins every year.

675
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,900
So these are people who take an active interest

676
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,100
in the final projects of this class

677
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,300
because, and this is important,

678
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:49,140
they know the final projects in this class are amazing, okay?

679
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,820
So there is a bar that has been set

680
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:55,260
by the former students of this class

681
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,820
that has put up a standard

682
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,820
that people take an interest on what this class does.

683
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,980
And that directly leads to interviews and jobs.

684
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,980
And it has happened and happens continuously.

685
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,780
I expect it to happen this year too.

686
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:12,060
So because we have people coming from the outside,

687
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,940
your audience then becomes the entire world, right?

688
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:20,020
The people from different fields, different technologies,

689
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,700
they're all gonna be watching.

690
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,460
So first of all,

691
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,220
your presentation should be a lot more polished,

692
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,220
practice it more.

693
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,300
Again, that's why the submission is on the Sunday.

694
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,500
And then you have the Monday

695
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,540
to practice your presentations if needed.

696
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,900
Don't include information about our logistics.

697
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,500
Our milestones are logistics.

698
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,500
Our pitches are logistics, right?

699
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,780
It's a way for me to keep a check on you saying,

700
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,100
hey guys, I've given you five weeks.

701
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,140
What have you come up with?

702
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,380
You know, that'll be dangerous if I try to do that.

703
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:51,580
So the milestones are kind of like a checkpoint for us.

704
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,460
But when you are showing this to the world,

705
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,660
show it as one complete thing.

706
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,500
You've done this project and here's the outcome of it.

707
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,900
So that's what we wanna show.

708
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,620
Most likely five minutes,

709
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:06,180
but I'll let you know what the exact time is for that.

710
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,180
And pretty much the same,

711
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,500
otherwise it's the same do's and don'ts

712
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,900
as the milestone presentations.

713
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,140
What you should expect to do in the final presentation.

714
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,060
Give an overview of the problem,

715
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,980
use one to two slides of the technical approach.

716
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,100
Absolutely show a demo if you can, a live demo.

717
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,380
And I will give you extra time

718
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,900
if you want to do a live demo.

719
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:35,340
I will add information about this

720
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,460
as we lead up to final presentations.

721
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:40,940
But if you plan to do a live demo, I will give you more time.

722
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:44,460
If you wanna include videos, again, well-recommended.

723
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,220
Include some performance analysis

724
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,020
about what the performance is,

725
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,460
what was expected, what you came up with.

726
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,780
And then any shortcomings of future work

727
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,340
that you may not have been able to achieve

728
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,180
or expect to do in the future.

729
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,140
You can do this as slides with the demo video

730
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:06,500
or prepare a video for the entire presentation.

731
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,660
But it's important that when you come up here,

732
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,500
you are talking.

733
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,860
You can have the presentation run as a video,

734
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,100
but you will have to speak.

735
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,180
You can't just record yourself talking

736
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,380
and just play the video.

737
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,780
So again, final project submissions are due

738
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,900
on December 11th.

739
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:28,100
And then final presentations would be Monday evening.

740
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,820
And between that,

741
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,820
I recommend that you take the time to sleep.

742
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,100
I know this is not the only class

743
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,140
and you'll have other classes,

744
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,700
but try to take the time to sleep.

745
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,940
Practice your presentations.

746
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,380
That'll be important.

747
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,900
And then work on any demo videos.

748
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,300
Again, the demo videos don't have to be submitted

749
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,980
to GitHub, so you're free to work on those.

750
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,740
Make changes to GitHub only if you find a serious bug

751
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,940
and let us know if you're doing that, okay?

752
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:56,580
So those are my notes for presentations, milestone,

753
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,140
and the final project presentation.

754
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,420
So any questions on this?

755
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,260
No?

756
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,140
You guys are awfully silent today.

757
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:20,660
All right, I'm sure there'll be something

758
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,220
and we'll come back.

759
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,060
All right.

760
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:24,900
Shadow teams.

761
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:28,700
So shadow teams was an idea I started in 2020,

762
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,260
I think, when the pandemic hit,

763
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:36,300
or it may have been 2019, I can't remember.

764
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,940
Essentially, the goal of a shadow team

765
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:42,940
is to be able to have a paired team.

766
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,980
So you are a team and there'll be your shadow team

767
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,460
who you can either bounce ideas off of,

768
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:51,100
you can be like, hey guys, you're trying to do this,

769
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,180
do you have any other suggestions?

770
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,820
And then you can practice your presentations with them.

771
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,020
Okay, so both of you should be like,

772
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,980
hey, let's practice our presentation.

773
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,860
Okay, you do your presentation.

774
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,740
The limit is five minutes, you go to eight minutes

775
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,940
and you're asking your shadow team,

776
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,020
okay, what should we cut down?

777
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,420
What is not important?

778
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,660
What went over your head that makes no sense

779
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,300
to put in this presentation?

780
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,020
Those kinds of things have become very, very important.

781
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,740
We recommend that you meet once a week,

782
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,180
at least for 30 to 60 minutes.

783
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:25,140
And if for nothing else to practice your presentation.

784
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:25,980
Okay.

785
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:32,660
Generally, you will be allowed to select your shadow team.

786
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,500
So once you do your pitches,

787
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,140
you will know what the other teams are doing.

788
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:40,220
So for example, if there are two teams doing web GPU,

789
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,780
you'll be shadow teams.

790
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,860
If there are two teams doing machine learning,

791
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,820
you'll likely be shadow teams, okay?

792
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,900
So the shadow teams should generally be relevant

793
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,740
to your topic.

794
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:54,420
And in the past years when we've done this,

795
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:57,660
shadow teams have always helped make presentations better.

796
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,260
And this is extremely clear.

797
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,060
Teams who come up here and do a sloppy presentation

798
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,620
will have never practiced with their shadow team.

799
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,700
The teams who come up here and do an amazing job

800
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,660
of the presentations, practice with their shadow teams.

801
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,100
And it has nothing to do with

802
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,060
whether you're an English native speaker

803
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,220
or how confident you are about speaking.

804
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,500
It is about the information you share

805
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,260
and bouncing it off of somebody

806
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,940
who is not doing what you're doing.

807
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,660
When you're doing these final projects,

808
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,660
you're gonna be knee deep in them.

809
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,500
Okay.

810
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,700
You're gonna be debugging them.

811
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,820
You're gonna be reading the papers.

812
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,420
And at some point what happens is

813
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,260
you forget what the basics are, right?

814
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,580
You forget that the things you understand,

815
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,100
the person in front of you doesn't understand

816
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,460
because they haven't read those same papers.

817
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:50,220
So the shadow teams will help you bring it up to a context

818
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,700
that other people will understand.

819
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,420
So it's absolutely vital that you meet

820
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,780
with their shadow teams and practice with them.

821
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:02,220
Now, again, it's not a free hand.

822
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,940
I will be checking in.

823
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:07,620
And the way I check in is through the shadow team surveys.

824
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:11,380
All of you filled out my pre-class survey, right?

825
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,300
When I asked for your information and your interest.

826
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,140
This is gonna be similar to that,

827
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,660
but it's gonna be very short.

828
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:21,460
It will take no more than three minutes for you to fill out.

829
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,300
The information I'm looking for is when you met,

830
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,820
how was your interaction?

831
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,620
What were some of the highlights?

832
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,620
And that's about it.

833
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,660
Okay.

834
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:36,660
So not filling these is a penalty.

835
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,420
It will go off your milestone points.

836
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,780
And sadly, I've had to do this in the past.

837
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,620
Again, it takes no more than three minutes.

838
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,140
While you're meeting with your shadow team,

839
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,060
you're ending your meeting, just type it out.

840
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:48,900
Okay.

841
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,740
And so any questions on, what did we do?

842
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:00,380
We did final presentations was done on shadow teams.

843
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,940
Any questions on shadow teams?

844
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,780
No.

845
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,940
I do deserve the right to change the shadow teams,

846
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:11,980
by the way.

847
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:16,660
Because there are times when just a group of friends

848
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,300
want to be each other's shadow teams

849
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,740
and have no sense of relations and topics.

850
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,220
So I will keep an eye on that,

851
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:26,380
but otherwise you are generally free to choose

852
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,620
as long as you're making conscious decisions.

853
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,700
Any other questions?

854
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,540
No.

855
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,740
Okay.

856
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,540
So shadow team service is done.

857
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,380
So what do you need to deliver?

858
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,580
So there are a few things.

859
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:48,420
The project pitch is due on November 6th.

860
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,460
So that's the first deliverable.

861
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,700
Your three milestone presentations are deliverable

862
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,900
on the day of the milestone,

863
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,140
and then you add them to GitHub.

864
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,060
Your final presentation,

865
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,380
your final code submission on GitHub,

866
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:03,740
and then four shadow team surveys, one for each week.

867
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,580
Okay.

868
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,420
You missed shadow team surveys.

869
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,980
I take no pride in docking points,

870
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,540
but please just finish it.

871
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,660
It's, you know, it's not a complex problem.

872
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,220
Just add the information there.

873
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,140
So any questions here?

874
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,180
Yeah.

875
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,580
All right.

876
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:29,900
So for your reference,

877
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,260
I've put in a bunch of final projects

878
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,260
for you to take a look at.

879
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,420
And this is, these can be good

880
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,700
because they did something technically amazing.

881
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,140
They can be good because they captured a really nice video

882
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,260
from the work they've done.

883
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,180
They could have written a great readme.

884
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,740
So these are all really, really good final projects.

885
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,980
This one up left is Wayne's.

886
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,020
This is Rachel's team.

887
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,420
That is Shubham's team who did Voxels and ReSTIR.

888
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:02,180
So, you know, again, really good projects.

889
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,620
These are not the only great projects.

890
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,700
So please visit previous year's websites

891
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,260
to actually see what was done.

892
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,260
I'm not gonna be walking through each of these,

893
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,700
but these are for your inspiration

894
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,420
when you go back home and start thinking about projects

895
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:18,020
to take a look at for inspiration of what is expected

896
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,420
and how students have gone on in the past

897
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,700
and done their projects.

898
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,700
Okay.

899
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,500
So let me skip through these.

900
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:30,060
This was the first DXR project in the class, by the way.

901
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,700
So a bunch of them.

902
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:41,260
And then there are links for you to reference

903
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:45,380
really good pitches, milestone, final project presentation.

904
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,180
So these are all like, again,

905
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:50,100
references for you to understand what is expected.

906
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,300
Any questions on this?

907
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,780
Nope.

908
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,580
No?

909
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,420
Okay.

910
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,340
So let's get into project ideas.

911
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:10,700
And these are, I will be very clear, only some ideas.

912
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:15,700
I ask for recommendations from people in the industry.

913
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:18,420
I come up with some of my ideas of my own,

914
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,660
but these are only some.

915
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,780
You are free to explore the world

916
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,700
and come up with your own ideas, okay?

917
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:28,740
So denoising is very big.

918
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,340
I think Eric Haynes shared that with us.

919
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,300
You guys saw the project poll.

920
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,180
If you want to do a denoising with Path Tracer and or DXR,

921
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,820
please, I think it's a wonderful topic.

922
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:42,540
It's definitely taking a lot of headway in the world.

923
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,300
So definitely recommend it.

924
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,460
I won't read all of this, but this is an idea from Nvidia.

925
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:51,140
So when Eric Haynes came in, I asked him,

926
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,660
hey, do you have ideas for final projects?

927
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,020
And he asked in basically Nvidia's research Slack channel

928
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,140
about what are good ideas for students.

929
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,180
And this is one of those.

930
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,180
So I won't read this.

931
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,460
This is for your reference to read at home.

932
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,660
DXR, I think, is an amazing topic.

933
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,180
And I write DXR, but it's really,

934
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,700
if you want to do welcome ray tracing,

935
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,380
that's perfectly fine with me too.

936
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,460
Again, in this case, so if you remember the second slide

937
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,420
that I showed you, it was that your project

938
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,580
must be a combination of things, right?

939
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,860
So in this case, DXR is one part of that.

940
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,300
And then you come up with, what do you want to do with DXR?

941
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,420
There are so many things you can do.

942
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,540
What do you want to apply DXR to?

943
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,220
So that's something you have to come up with.

944
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:38,540
Replicating papers from advances in real-time rendering.

945
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,860
I think it's an amazing course at SIGGRAPH.

946
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:44,220
Please check out the papers from there.

947
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:47,460
Both of these links are really good for that.

948
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:50,620
Check them out if that's what you want to re-implement.

949
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,940
Very well recommended.

950
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,460
Another idea coming from NVIDIA

951
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:59,020
is this Voxel space GitHub repo.

952
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,140
Again, I won't read the full text.

953
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,820
This is as it's coming from NVIDIA,

954
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:06,900
but another thing that you can think about

955
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,500
how to improve with the GPU.

956
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:16,620
ReSTIR, so we've had all the last two years,

957
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,620
we've probably had like four or five ReSTIR projects.

958
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:25,620
ReSTIR is spatial temporal sampling.

959
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,940
I forget the entire form,

960
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,940
but it's essentially a technique

961
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:32,700
for making ray tracing faster

962
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,460
because of improving denoising and stuff.

963
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,820
So if you try to do the seminal ReSTIR paper,

964
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,180
you'll get a no.

965
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,860
But if you try to do an advanced ReSTIR paper

966
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,380
with improvements and stuff that are coming every year,

967
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,780
sure, I'm very much open to that.

968
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:50,260
So this is one of those ideas coming from NVIDIA.

969
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:54,300
You can do a lot of machine learning projects,

970
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,740
both with graphics output and not graphics output.

971
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,940
These are some with graphical outputs,

972
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:03,620
you know, CNNL, STM, transformers.

973
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:07,140
Again, I may or may not understand all of these,

974
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,460
but I'm more than happy to connect you with Liam

975
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:12,180
and others who are interested in this

976
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,860
and have a lot of expertise here.

977
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:17,020
And Liam will be coming to the milestones and stuff

978
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,580
if any of you are doing machine learning projects.

979
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:24,460
And then there's machine learning on the compute side.

980
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:28,580
So this is object detections, speech to text.

981
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:31,660
Speech to text is a big hobby for Liam.

982
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,380
He does NLP, right?

983
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:36,220
So a bunch of things here, again,

984
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:39,020
very much of interest for this class

985
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,420
as well as for the industry.

986
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,020
Advanced projects in Vulkan, DirectX, Metal.

987
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,660
Again, these are APIs.

988
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:50,300
How you apply them is up to you, okay?

989
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,540
I think Metal is certainly very interesting.

990
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:55,340
Vulkan and DirectX, probably a little bit more common,

991
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:58,100
but definitely try to explore these if you want to.

992
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,180
WebGPU, I don't think I need to say much more

993
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,980
than what Brandon has already shared with us.

994
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:08,980
We had three WebGPU projects last year.

995
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,980
I'm looking to build on that.

996
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,900
I think that momentum is great.

997
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,780
People took notice.

998
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,380
The entire Chrome GPU team

999
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,820
joined the final project presentations last year.

1000
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:22,460
And maybe, Wayne, if I'm putting you on the spot,

1001
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,900
you were in touch with the Chrome GPU team

1002
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,300
and maybe why don't you share

1003
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,900
some of how your communication with them went

1004
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:34,020
and how it's like, in complete honesty,

1005
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,820
how it's like to interact with them.

1006
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:41,060
Yeah, I think they are very,

1007
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,900
definitely open to the WebGPU team.

1008
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:46,140
I mean, I'm sure you guys heard from Brandon.

1009
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:49,860
The whole team, they're very open to project ideas

1010
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:52,860
and they really want to make the API better.

1011
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:57,180
So whenever you have questions,

1012
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:00,300
you can really just reach out to them directly

1013
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,140
during your project.

1014
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:05,500
So I'd say, don't be scared.

1015
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,180
If it's like WebGPU is such a new thing,

1016
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:11,660
you can definitely get a ton of support from the team.

1017
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,620
Yeah, it was way more complex when you were doing it.

1018
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:14,980
We are a year ahead of that

1019
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,900
and there's been so much progress made.

1020
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,660
It's very, very close to standardization.

1021
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:20,340
So it should be a lot better experience

1022
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,380
for you guys as well.

1023
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,060
Okay, again, this is an API.

1024
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:27,660
How you apply it is up to you.

1025
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:32,340
This next one is pretty close to me.

1026
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:37,020
So for geospatial, so you can essentially

1027
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:41,500
take the entire globe and stream it into Unreal Engine

1028
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:45,620
or on WebGL using Cesium JS.

1029
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,500
If you have ideas that you want to work on,

1030
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,740
for example, I think back in like 2017,

1031
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,420
one team did like a snow simulation

1032
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,540
inside Cesium JS using WebGL.

1033
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:02,020
If you have ideas that would help with something like this,

1034
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:04,700
again, if you think of ideas in the metaverse

1035
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:07,420
or digital twins, those kinds of things,

1036
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:09,540
if you want to improve some of this,

1037
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,580
I will certainly help you.

1038
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:13,060
I will get you connected with developers at Cesium

1039
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,180
and would strongly encourage

1040
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:16,180
if there's anything you want to do here.

1041
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:21,300
Similarly, that's going to come November 14,

1042
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,860
but even before that,

1043
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,860
NVIDIA Omniverse is a fantastic platform.

1044
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:27,180
We've been playing around with it a little bit.

1045
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:32,780
If you want to use NVIDIA Omniverse

1046
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:35,100
to help build an amazing project

1047
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,620
based on some of your interests,

1048
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,820
again, that is very open.

1049
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:41,460
I'm more than happy to get you connected.

1050
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,580
For those of you who love Python,

1051
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:46,060
the NVIDIA Omniverse API is written in Python,

1052
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,220
so that'll be a good opportunity

1053
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,140
for you to work with that as well.

1054
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,260
Again, Omniverse provides the platform.

1055
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:53,420
It's up to you what you want to do with it.

1056
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:59,300
Other general ideas using game engines,

1057
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,100
you can use Unity or Unreal Engine

1058
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:03,060
and add a key feature on top of that

1059
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,020
that takes advantage of the GPU.

1060
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:08,820
This could be compute shaders

1061
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,580
or anything like that that you're using

1062
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,980
to help advance a certain feature.

1063
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,740
Similarly for O3D,

1064
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,460
some of you may or may not have heard of this,

1065
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:22,900
but O3D is formerly Crytek,

1066
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,780
used for Crysis, of course,

1067
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,620
that became Amazon Lumberyard,

1068
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:29,900
and then Lumberyard became O3D

1069
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:30,860
through a collaboration

1070
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:33,580
between Linux Foundation and Amazon.

1071
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:36,340
So O3D is a very new game engine

1072
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:38,300
from that point of view.

1073
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:41,580
It was made open source last year, last summer,

1074
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,860
and there's a lot of momentum behind it,

1075
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,900
especially with Amazon's backing

1076
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:50,260
on having a AAA-grade open source game engine.

1077
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:53,620
So there's a lot of good stuff that is available

1078
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,700
that you can do within O3D,

1079
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,260
so I would certainly recommend that as well.

1080
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,140
Mesh shading is a great idea as well.

1081
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:05,860
We had Manuel Cramer give a guest lecture in 2020.

1082
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:09,460
Very, very interesting topic,

1083
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:10,300
having mesh shaders,

1084
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,100
so if that's something you're interested in,

1085
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,620
again, wonderful, wonderful topic to explore.

1086
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:18,220
3D mesh classification and segmentation

1087
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:19,580
is really good as well,

1088
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:21,900
where you're taking data from the real world,

1089
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,220
3D models and stuff,

1090
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:24,340
and trying to classify,

1091
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,220
this is a window, this is a door,

1092
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:27,980
the door opens this way,

1093
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:31,300
and adding semantic information to 3D models.

1094
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:33,820
They are complex topics,

1095
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,620
but certainly well worth exploring as well.

1096
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,500
Some other topics,

1097
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,060
Three.js, Babylon.js,

1098
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:46,340
again, just like the game engines I mentioned before,

1099
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:50,620
using Three.js and Babylon.js is certainly an option.

1100
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:53,260
Take a look at the GitHub issues that they have

1101
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:55,060
and what they may want to explore.

1102
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,500
NVIDIA Optics is great too,

1103
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,180
although I would recommend doing something

1104
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:01,300
with Omniverse first before you consider Optics,

1105
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,580
but Optics is great too.

1106
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:06,180
And then any people from machine learning conferences,

1107
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,660
SIGGRAPH, all of that,

1108
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:09,380
so I've added a link here as well.

1109
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:14,380
Couple of other topics that came from NVIDIA,

1110
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:16,540
massively parallel collision detection.

1111
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,980
Again, I'm just giving you four words,

1112
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,780
what it actually means is up to you.

1113
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,020
And then in general,

1114
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:25,660
trying to improve performance or memory

1115
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,540
without affecting any existing algorithms.

1116
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,860
So trying to make significant improvements

1117
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:32,140
to existing algorithms is really good as well

1118
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,940
and valued a lot by the industry.

1119
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:37,780
Okay, so I've given you ideas,

1120
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:39,380
now let me give you anti-ideas,

1121
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:40,980
things that I don't want to see.

1122
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:44,180
Don't use Vulkan Compute Shader.

1123
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:45,700
You're doing that as part of project five,

1124
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,460
I don't really want to see that, okay?

1125
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,460
You want to come up with a better idea.

1126
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:55,420
Multi-GPU was a thing back in 2013.

1127
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,580
It's not really a thing now,

1128
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,300
the GPUs are far more powerful.

1129
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:05,140
Simulation, depending on the algorithm

1130
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,220
and the goal it's trying to accomplish,

1131
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:09,380
can, may or may not be good.

1132
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:12,180
So if you're thinking of doing a simulation,

1133
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:14,980
what a simulation, plot simulation or stuff like that,

1134
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,820
please run it by me next Monday

1135
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:18,460
when we have those office hours.

1136
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:24,180
If you are trying to extend your CUDA pathways,

1137
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,940
I have a very, very strong idea behind it.

1138
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,420
If you come to me with the idea that,

1139
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:30,940
okay, I'm going to take my path tracer

1140
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:33,660
and all the features that I didn't do in project three time,

1141
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:35,940
I'm going to do now, not worth it.

1142
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,180
Like, absolutely do it,

1143
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:40,540
just not part of the final project, okay?

1144
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:42,180
I strongly recommend all of you do

1145
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:43,340
because it's a great project,

1146
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,060
you can keep improving on it,

1147
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:46,860
just not as part of the path tracer.

1148
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:51,380
I mentioned ReSTIR, we have had four in the last two years.

1149
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:52,740
Again, try the newer papers,

1150
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:55,900
don't try to re-implement it.

1151
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:58,980
So this quote again came from NVIDIA.

1152
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:05,420
And this is from somebody who teaches a class like I do,

1153
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:08,260
they work at NVIDIA and they teach a class.

1154
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:11,540
If the goal is to go implement a paper

1155
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:14,900
from the last five years with no improvement,

1156
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,100
that'll get you a B-plus

1157
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,740
and that's kind of what will happen in this class as well.

1158
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:19,780
Okay?

1159
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:23,180
So the work that we expect is that you do something unique

1160
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:26,620
from either 2021 or 2022

1161
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:29,940
and or make significant improvements to it.

1162
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,860
So those are anti-ideas.

1163
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:35,620
And generally my goal behind anti-ideas,

1164
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:40,300
the why is again, so that you are doing amazing work.

1165
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,140
Okay?

1166
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:45,140
If you are taking, let's say this one,

1167
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:47,420
this CUDA path tracer idea,

1168
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:48,620
you're not making improvements,

1169
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:51,260
this has been done in 2016, right?

1170
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:54,660
We are in 2022, we want to do the latest and greatest stuff

1171
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:56,740
and you have the opportunity to do that.

1172
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:00,540
If you do make improvements to the CUDA path tracer,

1173
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:01,820
you're falling behind.

1174
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:03,700
There are students who are doing more advanced things.

1175
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:06,180
So the goal is for you to do more advanced things

1176
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:07,020
rather than me saying,

1177
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:09,100
hey, I don't like this, don't do this.

1178
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:10,500
I love the path tracer.

1179
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,140
There's a reason why it stayed as a project

1180
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:13,620
for over 10 years.

1181
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:14,700
Continue to improve on it,

1182
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,500
just don't do it as a final project.

1183
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:18,540
Okay.

1184
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,380
So I'll pause there and take questions.

1185
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:25,500
And I've gone through a bunch of topics.

1186
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,740
Again, those topics are not what you're limited to.

1187
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:29,460
You can come up with your own ideas.

1188
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,220
Those are just suggestions from me.

1189
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:32,060
Okay.

1190
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:54,340
I mean, you have to come up with that, right?

1191
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:57,940
Like you have from this Monday until next Monday

1192
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,700
to come up with that plan.

1193
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:01,420
Like you may have,

1194
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:05,260
I want to make every tree in the world render really nice.

1195
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:06,100
Sure.

1196
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,260
Great idea.

1197
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:09,620
How you want to go about doing that is up to you.

1198
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,700
And that's the part you are going to figure out

1199
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:12,940
in the next two weeks.

1200
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:15,940
If it was just, hey, here are 15 papers, pick one,

1201
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:18,420
then I'm going to give you two days for it, right?

1202
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:20,460
You guys kind of see it in 660 and stuff.

1203
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:21,620
I love 660 too.

1204
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:22,780
I think it's a fantastic class

1205
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:24,780
that gets you to implement papers.

1206
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,220
But here, I want to give you that time and space

1207
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:29,220
to really think about what you're doing.

1208
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:30,580
Edward.

1209
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:01,140
Yes.

1210
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:03,860
So this comes up every year.

1211
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,060
If you're trying to do a machine learning project

1212
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:11,180
that requires you to do training,

1213
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:13,420
either understand the requirements

1214
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,140
and have the data available.

1215
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:18,740
Again, these two weeks are there for you to research that.

1216
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:21,940
There are data sets available in most places.

1217
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:23,820
If you're trying to re-implement a paper

1218
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:26,700
that needs some training data, go contact the author.

1219
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,780
Maybe they'll just give it to you, right?

1220
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:32,660
Don't come to me at the end of milestone two

1221
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:35,380
and be like, hey guys, we have no training data.

1222
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:36,820
Our project's dead in the water.

1223
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:37,660
Please don't do that.

1224
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:39,780
It's not good for you, okay?

1225
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:43,180
So think about this problem early.

1226
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:46,420
If you are planning to do any kind of project,

1227
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:49,820
not just machine learning that requires a dependency

1228
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:53,060
that you don't have access to, think about it early.

1229
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:55,500
If you don't think there's a solution to that,

1230
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:57,260
leave the problem, okay?

1231
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,660
You can do it in the future.

1232
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:01,820
What are the questions?

1233
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:09,420
Any other questions?

1234
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:14,660
All right, by now I would have covered most of the FAQs,

1235
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:16,740
but let's go through them, okay.

1236
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:20,900
Very commonly asked.

1237
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,580
I want to do a project on a topic

1238
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:24,140
that has been done in the past.

1239
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:25,980
Is that allowed?

1240
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:28,700
Again, the goal of the final projects

1241
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,580
is to move you forward,

1242
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:33,140
allow you to do industry relevant topics.

1243
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:35,140
If you do something from previous years,

1244
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:36,500
you're just falling behind.

1245
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,660
You're not on the cutting edge.

1246
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:42,380
So can you take inspiration from something

1247
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,620
that was done in past years?

1248
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,580
Absolutely, please do, okay?

1249
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:47,940
Even projects that were done in previous years

1250
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,940
were cutting edge for their time.

1251
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,780
Take inspiration, but come to me with

1252
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:56,260
what are the advances that you're making to that, okay?

1253
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:57,780
What changes are you making

1254
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:00,220
that is making it relevant to 2022?

1255
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:05,500
Generic question.

1256
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,300
I want to work on a topic or technology

1257
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:08,940
that I have no experience with.

1258
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:11,540
My response to that is always to be brave.

1259
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:15,580
You guys, most of you, if not all of you took this class

1260
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,620
knowing nothing about CUDA.

1261
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:20,020
And now you can pretty much walk into any CUDA job

1262
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:21,980
and ace it, right?

1263
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:25,300
So no, I'm being very serious about it.

1264
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:29,820
So there'll be enough time for you to learn

1265
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:32,540
and implement during the final projects, okay?

1266
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:35,900
It's not two weeks deadline every single time.

1267
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:37,660
So be brave.

1268
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:40,020
If the topic and technology is relevant to you,

1269
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:41,140
you are interested in it,

1270
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:43,940
you think you want to work in that field in the future,

1271
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:45,060
do it.

1272
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:46,740
I highly encourage you to do that.

1273
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:49,220
Okay.

1274
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:53,180
I don't think this is so much of a problem these days,

1275
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:55,100
but was in the past.

1276
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:56,820
Let's say you want to do a DXR project

1277
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,860
and you need one of the modern GPUs

1278
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:01,900
and you don't have access to one.

1279
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:05,540
Well, firstly, I think most of the Moodle app computers

1280
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:10,540
now have at least a fallback capable DXR GPU.

1281
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:14,780
If that doesn't work,

1282
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:19,780
all of you receive credits from Azure, AWS or Google Cloud

1283
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,980
where they have GPUs that are capable,

1284
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,620
Tesla T4s and others.

1285
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:26,780
You can take advantage of those,

1286
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:30,220
use those for your DXR projects.

1287
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:34,540
And if you're planning to do this,

1288
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:36,460
let us know as soon as possible.

1289
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:40,220
Okay.

1290
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:41,940
You may or may not be doing something

1291
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:43,300
that's graphics or visual.

1292
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:45,300
Perfectly fine.

1293
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,500
We've had so many projects do that in the past.

1294
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,820
You should, if in that case,

1295
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:53,620
you may or may not have videos and images,

1296
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:56,340
but what you will have is performance analysis

1297
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:57,420
and some kind of results.

1298
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,140
You want to be focusing on that.

1299
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:06,020
Another common question, you're from CIS.

1300
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:07,900
You don't really have a graphics background.

1301
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:10,860
You don't want to do a graphics related project,

1302
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,180
projects that you can work on.

1303
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:16,020
Again, I've shared a bunch of those projects already,

1304
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:20,100
but essentially the core piece of advice is

1305
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:21,780
take something that's of interest to you

1306
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:23,140
and put it to the GPU.

1307
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,540
Whether that's machine learning, deep learning,

1308
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:31,540
autonomous driving, Tegras, Apple Metal, anything

1309
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:35,140
that's relevant to you and you are interested in

1310
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:36,980
that will generally be okay with me.

1311
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:41,660
I've generally covered this, I think.

1312
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:43,060
So I won't go over it again.

1313
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:49,060
If you're working on a long-term research or PhD project,

1314
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:50,380
and this has happened in the past,

1315
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:53,180
where you've been working on a problem,

1316
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:56,020
mostly on the CPU and maybe multi-threaded on the GPU,

1317
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:57,500
and now you want to move it to the GPU

1318
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,180
and take performance advantage of that.

1319
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:02,460
This is okay, this is acceptable,

1320
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,500
if, under these conditions,

1321
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,540
and all of these must be satisfied.

1322
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:07,780
There's no double dipping.

1323
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:09,980
You're not getting grades in two different courses

1324
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:11,580
for the same work, okay?

1325
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,220
The goals are clearly laid out.

1326
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:18,500
What is in the research that you're doing

1327
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:21,580
and what is required for the class are clearly laid out.

1328
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:26,460
And if necessary, I'll request faculty or researcher

1329
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:29,060
also approve the work, okay?

1330
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:31,220
And other conditions based on your research and stuff

1331
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:33,060
may be taken up case by case.

1332
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:36,580
Any questions on this?

1333
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:38,460
Those of you who may be involved in research

1334
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:39,940
and maybe thinking about this?

1335
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:44,860
No?

1336
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:46,620
Okay.

1337
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,020
Missing milestones is not okay.

1338
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:53,740
I'll be very, very clear about that.

1339
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:59,780
The only exception under which I will allow you

1340
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:02,500
to miss a milestone and forgive you for it

1341
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:05,620
is if you are going on site for an interview and stuff,

1342
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:07,780
which is a lot less common these days.

1343
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:09,580
It was a lot more common before the pandemic

1344
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:12,500
that people would fly to Google or Nvidia

1345
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,580
or anywhere and do in-person interviews.

1346
01:00:14,580 --> 01:00:16,660
Doesn't really happen much these days.

1347
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:20,020
So the only circumstance under which you miss a milestone

1348
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:22,540
is, again, the goal of this class

1349
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:23,900
to prepare you for the industry.

1350
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:26,700
If you're doing an interview that helps you get a job,

1351
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,060
okay, fine, acceptable.

1352
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:30,980
But otherwise, not okay to miss.

1353
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:34,100
Now, if you have to miss,

1354
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:37,220
make sure that the rest of your team is presenting.

1355
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:41,500
And before you leave to go wherever you have to

1356
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,540
or miss the milestone,

1357
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:46,180
schedule a time with the TAs,

1358
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:49,260
AT or multiple TAs prior to the milestone,

1359
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:50,300
not after the milestone,

1360
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:53,140
prior to the milestone and discuss the progress you've made.

1361
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:53,980
Okay?

1362
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:57,780
So again, the importance is on communication.

1363
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:58,620
Don't hide.

1364
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:00,660
If there is a problem,

1365
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:02,700
if you're not able to make a milestone,

1366
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,300
whether you have a job interview or you fall sick,

1367
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,460
communicate it before.

1368
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:09,380
If you communicate it after, there's not much I can do.

1369
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:10,220
Okay?

1370
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:16,900
This is not really relevant anymore.

1371
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:19,180
It was more when we were remote and stuff

1372
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:23,420
that people were studying from India and Australia

1373
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:26,700
and China and Japan and New Zealand and stuff.

1374
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:29,420
And the times were really, really odd, right?

1375
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:30,700
So that's not a problem,

1376
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:33,220
but just in case I'm leaving this in here.

1377
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:37,220
For shadow teams,

1378
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:39,340
if there are an odd number of teams that come up,

1379
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:40,940
again, because I don't pick the teams

1380
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:42,820
that are 30 students in the class.

1381
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:44,900
If everybody tries to pick a team of three,

1382
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,420
that's 10 teams.

1383
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:48,580
But if some of you do two or one,

1384
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:49,660
you're going to have more teams.

1385
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:52,580
And sometimes you may end up with odd teams.

1386
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:53,420
In that case,

1387
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:56,460
we'll just make one or two groups of three,

1388
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:57,820
three teams are shadow teams.

1389
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:00,980
And this has worked generally well in the past.

1390
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,540
Okay?

1391
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:04,460
That's it for final projects overview.

1392
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:09,020
Now, the floor is open for you to ask questions

1393
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:10,820
about what's important to you

1394
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:14,580
and what you think should matter for final projects.

1395
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:16,820
Again, this is half your grade.

1396
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:19,540
So ask all the questions you want right now.

1397
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:20,900
Of course, our discussion is open,

1398
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:24,300
but here I'll be able to answer in much more detail.

1399
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:28,060
Yeah?

1400
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:31,060
So if you're going to do an XR related project,

1401
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:32,860
do you have any resources at that time?

1402
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:34,460
Sorry, what related?

1403
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:36,660
XR related project.

1404
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:37,500
XR?

1405
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,540
Yes.

1406
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:40,500
And what kind of resources do you want from me?

1407
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:42,500
I was like, you know,

1408
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:43,820
now we are in the past,

1409
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:44,660
we are in the industry.

1410
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:45,500
Yeah.

1411
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,340
Absolutely.

1412
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:48,540
I mean, Steve Lane is probably the number one resource.

1413
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:49,660
Steve Lane is amazing.

1414
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:53,700
But if you want to get connected to, for example,

1415
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:54,940
the people at Oculus,

1416
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:56,380
yeah, I'll get you connected.

1417
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:01,380
What else?

1418
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:05,380
You guys have been surprisingly quiet today.

1419
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:09,220
Deep?

1420
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:12,620
What if I'm just really bad at coming up with ideas?

1421
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:14,660
You can join other people's ideas.

1422
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:16,620
That's the goal, right?

1423
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:18,820
It's not that every person comes up with an idea,

1424
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:21,300
you put it in a bowl and pick one out of that.

1425
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:22,140
Please don't do that.

1426
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:24,580
Pick something that you think is worth working on.

1427
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:26,140
Again, you're not going to be able to do it

1428
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:26,980
if you don't have a team.

1429
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:28,060
You're not going to be able to do it

1430
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:28,900
if you don't have a team.

1431
01:03:28,900 --> 01:03:29,740
You're not going to be able to do it

1432
01:03:29,740 --> 01:03:30,580
if you don't have a team.

1433
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:31,420
It's worth working on.

1434
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:34,300
Again, you're going to be spending significant time

1435
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:36,420
on this and frustration on it.

1436
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:38,700
So pick a topic that you'll actually want to come

1437
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:41,580
on the other side of and be proud of what you've done.

1438
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:47,180
What are the questions?

1439
01:03:57,420 --> 01:03:58,500
Wayne, did I miss anything?

1440
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,300
Wayne, Shubham, did I miss anything?

1441
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:14,780
Yeah, don't pick up projects that are too hard.

1442
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:17,020
Don't pick up projects that are too easy.

1443
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,620
Find a good, reasonable balance.

1444
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:23,060
And if the project's too hard, I'll tell you it's too hard.

1445
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:25,300
Although I will say, I will encourage you to take it on,

1446
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:27,940
but I will say, hey, I think this is too hard.

1447
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:29,860
And I'll be honest about it.

1448
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:34,860
Again, I will reiterate, it gives me no pride

1449
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:39,060
or no ego to either give the entire class an A-plus

1450
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:41,460
or the entire class an F.

1451
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:43,540
These grades, I'm here to teach you.

1452
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:45,980
I'm here to encourage all of you to do amazing work.

1453
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:47,540
If all of you deserve an A-plus,

1454
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:49,860
I will give all of you an A-plus.

1455
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:52,860
So the goal for me is to facilitate

1456
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:54,260
the projects you want to do.

1457
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:00,780
Let's say, I think you sort of addressed this

1458
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:03,620
while you were sliding to be more clear.

1459
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:08,060
What are the stipulations of re-skilling a project

1460
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:11,460
if you take it on, you make good progress,

1461
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:14,620
and then something happens and now it's impossible?

1462
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:17,900
Shubham, do you want to share your experience from last year?

1463
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:19,660
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1464
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:23,100
Maybe, again, you guys have done it, so you share.

1465
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:27,700
Yeah, so when I was in, I think it was impossible for us.

1466
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:32,460
If you have to redo the project, that's kind of what we did.

1467
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:34,020
Like, we didn't change our project,

1468
01:05:34,020 --> 01:05:36,780
but we had to make everything from ground up again.

1469
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:40,300
That's because the project was actually fairly hard,

1470
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:42,940
and that's what Shehzad told us.

1471
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:44,260
I think it was our first pitch also

1472
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:46,860
that this project is going to be really hard to do,

1473
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:49,580
but if you guys want to do it, then do it.

1474
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:52,740
So, yeah, like, but I would say,

1475
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:56,220
even if you have faced a situation like that,

1476
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:59,060
let everybody know, but don't change it.

1477
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:02,060
I think just, like, when you are deciding on,

1478
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:05,300
keep everything in mind and then start from there.

1479
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:07,660
Yeah, you'll be able to do it at the end.

1480
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:10,260
So, I think Shubham laid it out well.

1481
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:12,140
There can be different reasons

1482
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:14,260
your project falls off the rails, right?

1483
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:16,700
And the goal is to, how do we pick back up?

1484
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:21,100
The project may be behind because you underestimated

1485
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:22,820
the task of milestone one, for example,

1486
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:24,980
but you reasonably understand what's required

1487
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:26,380
and you think you'll catch up.

1488
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:28,100
Sure, no problem.

1489
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:30,300
That just means you move a few features around

1490
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,980
and or you may want to drop a few features.

1491
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:35,100
Again, communicating early and often

1492
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:36,940
is the key thing that I have to share.

1493
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:38,460
So, that's one.

1494
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:41,380
The second thing might be, you may realize,

1495
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:43,940
oh my God, what kind of project have you picked up?

1496
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:47,100
Again, it's not unheard of, it's happened.

1497
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,260
That's why I'm giving you this information.

1498
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:54,340
First, try to, again, try to reach out to the authors.

1499
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:56,740
As soon as you pick the project, reach out to the authors.

1500
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:57,900
That's the first thing you do.

1501
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:59,700
Hey, I'm thinking about doing this.

1502
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:01,420
Do you have any recommendations for me?

1503
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:03,780
And people will love to give you those, okay?

1504
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:08,260
And then if you still find yourself in a tough spot

1505
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:09,940
where you don't know the way forward,

1506
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:11,180
again, reach out to them and be like,

1507
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:12,420
hey guys, you're stuck here.

1508
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:14,620
I think it was in pretty much the first class

1509
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:18,340
where I was like, the students were doing a shallow water,

1510
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:19,860
they were stuck, they reached out to the authors

1511
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:22,180
and the author was like, hey, just change this.

1512
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:23,220
And it worked.

1513
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:24,740
And usually that fixes it.

1514
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:30,900
If everything given, you still need to pivot

1515
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:33,340
and you need to change your project.

1516
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:36,540
Again, communicate that off as early as possible

1517
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:40,260
with good reason, with good reason

1518
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:42,100
and a good plan with that.

1519
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,340
If you come to me with, hey Shahzan,

1520
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:46,460
we are really struggling with this.

1521
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:47,460
My first question is, okay,

1522
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:48,580
have you reached out to the authors?

1523
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:51,380
Have you tried a bunch of things, right?

1524
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:53,300
Make sure you've done all of that before you come to me.

1525
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:54,860
And then even when you come to me, be like,

1526
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:56,820
hey, this is the problem we are having.

1527
01:07:56,820 --> 01:07:59,740
Here's why we think it's insurmountable

1528
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:02,180
and we won't have a good final presentation.

1529
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:03,700
Here's the pivot we wanna make,

1530
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:06,100
here's the projects we wanna change or stuff like that.

1531
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:07,820
Whatever it may be, okay?

1532
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:11,300
You had a question, sorry.

1533
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:15,060
So suppose we're trying to create a research

1534
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:20,060
and the original product got screwed up

1535
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:25,660
and if I were to use the research in metals

1536
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:30,300
and does that count as a viable option?

1537
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:33,340
Yeah, generally I would say generally yes,

1538
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:34,540
but it also depends.

1539
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:37,380
So for example, if you're taking a paper from 2013

1540
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:40,020
and trying to do it in metal, I'd say probably not.

1541
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:42,340
Unless you're making significant changes.

1542
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:45,740
If you're taking a paper from 2022 GTC,

1543
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:47,420
NVIDIA's GPU technology conference

1544
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:49,900
and you wanna do that in metal, sure, absolutely.

1545
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:50,900
Yeah.

1546
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:01,020
Is there any potential budget allocation

1547
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:03,620
to buy data sets if needed?

1548
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:06,340
I don't know how I fund that.

1549
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:09,460
I don't even know what the university process or anything,

1550
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,980
but if it comes up, at least let me know

1551
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:15,380
if there's something that I can help with.

1552
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:17,700
Even if I don't know, I'll probably ask DeepLane

1553
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:19,580
to see if there's something like that.

1554
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:21,740
What else?

1555
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:30,740
Yeah.

1556
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:32,220
Off the top of your head,

1557
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:35,180
is anything relating to state of the fusion

1558
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:38,620
or generation viable in the scope of your project?

1559
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:39,940
Yeah, why not?

1560
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:43,100
Again, ask Liam what better ideas might be.

1561
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:45,900
You have his email, feel free to email him

1562
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:48,780
and get suggestions from what will be good ideas.

1563
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:50,500
Again, the goal is not that,

1564
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:53,300
A, I don't know much about machine learning,

1565
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:54,700
but I can at least give advice,

1566
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:56,340
but my advice could be dangerous.

1567
01:09:57,380 --> 01:09:59,580
Liam's advice is gonna be very industry-derived.

1568
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:01,620
Just like I can tell you what Cesium does

1569
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:03,420
and anything related to Cesium,

1570
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:05,860
Liam can tell you the world's end

1571
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:08,180
about natural language processing

1572
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:09,380
or machine learning in general.

1573
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:11,260
So that's my recommendation there.

1574
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:12,900
You may reach out to other professors as well

1575
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:15,260
to understand what might be required,

1576
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:17,260
but it's up to you ultimately.

1577
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:21,180
What are the questions?

1578
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:24,860
Anybody already have the project ideas?

1579
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:27,380
It's okay to say yes.

1580
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:30,580
It'll only help you find good teammates.

1581
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:35,540
No?

1582
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:37,780
Okay.

1583
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:39,100
I don't know if anyone wants to do this with me.

1584
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:39,940
No, no, no.

1585
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:41,500
If you wanna share them.

1586
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:47,660
Okay.

1587
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:50,460
Why not?

1588
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:52,820
Well,

1589
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:55,820
two ideas, right?

1590
01:10:55,820 --> 01:10:57,340
One is

1591
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:00,340
pose estimation

1592
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:04,260
to drive a 2D body sprite.

1593
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:08,300
So currently there's motion capture

1594
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:10,820
and there's camera-based motion capture.

1595
01:11:10,820 --> 01:11:14,580
A motion capture retargets poses

1596
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:17,020
into rigs of 3D

1597
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:20,060
models.

1598
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:22,260
I was thinking that if we take,

1599
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:25,060
combine like the existing

1600
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:28,660
pose estimation from camera,

1601
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:30,780
like monocular camera view

1602
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:31,860
onto

1603
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:34,940
a rig

1604
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:38,300
with like 2D body

1605
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:42,300
that can be novel.

1606
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:44,700
That's one of the other things.

1607
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,780
Although I think that's been done quite a few times.

1608
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:49,860
I think that's being done quite a few times.

1609
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:52,500
You may want to look into that.

1610
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,420
Yeah, again, it depends on the combination,

1611
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:56,660
but that idea itself,

1612
01:11:56,660 --> 01:11:59,100
I think there's a lot of research being done on it.

1613
01:11:59,100 --> 01:11:59,940
Yeah.

1614
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:01,860
I know that pose estimation is big.

1615
01:12:01,860 --> 01:12:02,700
Yeah.

1616
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:06,340
It's the mesh deformation of like a 2D.

1617
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:07,180
Oh yeah.

1618
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:08,580
If you want to do mesh deformation as well.

1619
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:09,420
Okay.

1620
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:10,420
If you're just doing the skeleton,

1621
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:11,260
then that's kind of.

1622
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:12,100
No, no, no.

1623
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:14,420
Because like the skeleton is like the output, right?

1624
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:16,820
It's the idea of like retargeting that skeleton

1625
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:18,620
onto a,

1626
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:21,100
because like with 3D mesh, it's a mesh.

1627
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:21,940
Yeah.

1628
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:23,540
And that's driven by like a rig.

1629
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:24,380
Yeah.

1630
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:26,980
But with 2D, the rules are different.

1631
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:30,340
So like, I feel like that could be parallelized

1632
01:12:30,340 --> 01:12:32,620
in terms of how those calculations are done.

1633
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:36,260
And then it will like real time

1634
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:39,260
and camera to output sort of thing.

1635
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:42,860
The other thing, which is the machine learning thing

1636
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:43,700
is that

1637
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:48,740
there is a fundamental difference between face,

1638
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:53,020
like in non-photorealistic rendering of faces,

1639
01:12:53,020 --> 01:12:58,020
lots of models are scripted to break facial planes

1640
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:00,300
based on camera perspective,

1641
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:05,300
because the 2D aesthetic is not geometrically,

1642
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:10,540
like geospatially like consistent based on camera angles.

1643
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:15,020
And I was thinking potentially doing

1644
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:18,060
the machine learning thing to see if you can just,

1645
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:24,180
given like two branches off of that,

1646
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:28,340
this is just me talking.

1647
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:31,140
One is give a head-on perspective

1648
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:33,860
and you try and get like a three-fourths perspective,

1649
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:36,860
or it's you are given a three-fourths perspective

1650
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:38,060
of like a 3D model,

1651
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:41,900
that you like, you perturb it

1652
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:44,820
to make it look more like a 3D style.

1653
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:47,860
And like, that's, I know like there are a bunch of papers.

1654
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:51,540
Yeah, what you're saying,

1655
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:53,900
and I'm extrapolating here,

1656
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:56,980
is take the entire history of Japanese anime

1657
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:58,820
and create a 3D world out of it.

1658
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:02,380
Yeah, because if that happens,

1659
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:06,020
if that happens, right,

1660
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:08,180
CG in anime is solved.

1661
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:09,580
Yeah.

1662
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:11,220
But I mean, piecemeal.

1663
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:12,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1664
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:14,940
Anybody have any other ideas?

1665
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:19,580
Okay.

1666
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:20,420
David?

1667
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:25,700
I was thinking of doing like a radar tracer.

1668
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:28,420
So it would be similar to like a path tracer,

1669
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:31,860
but instead you're like simulating radar waves

1670
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:32,740
instead of light.

1671
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:34,580
So if you do that,

1672
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:37,220
you would take like an airframe of like a fighter jet

1673
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:38,900
or like a boat,

1674
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:41,820
and you could check the radar signature.

1675
01:14:41,820 --> 01:14:46,820
And basically it's how like stealth hardware is built,

1676
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:52,140
like trying to minimize the radar signature of the kid.

1677
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:54,940
And also like thought about different ways

1678
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:59,580
that you could even manipulate the airframe

1679
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:01,540
or the ship hull to make it,

1680
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:06,540
you would have a smaller radar signature.

1681
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:12,020
Yeah, I think that could be very interesting.

1682
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:15,420
And other, Eric Cain's in his presentation

1683
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:16,780
also brought up something like that.

1684
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:21,060
If RF and 5G propagation is really big,

1685
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:22,700
so all of those ideas could be very, very good

1686
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:23,820
where you're taking ray tracing

1687
01:15:23,820 --> 01:15:27,820
and applying it to non-visual stuff as well.

1688
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:32,060
Okay, last call for any other ideas.

1689
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:33,900
Uta.

1690
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:44,340
I think the reason for Facebook is that it's a big company.

1691
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:50,660
I thought that Facebook was a big one,

1692
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:53,020
so I was thinking of using it to get able to,

1693
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:55,620
I've never seen a middle in AI.

1694
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:02,740
If I can play some digital,

1695
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:08,260
that's something I'm doing with Facebook.

1696
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:10,660
Of course, there's some limitations that it should do.

1697
01:16:10,660 --> 01:16:12,540
Yeah, you may want to think about

1698
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:13,780
what are the applications of that,

1699
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:15,060
and maybe you would talk to Steve Blain

1700
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:16,860
about what he thinks about that idea.

1701
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:19,940
I know he takes a lot of interest in AR, so talk about it.

1702
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:22,340
Yeah, I was reading about it,

1703
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:26,260
and I think it will have the same implications.

1704
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:28,500
Yeah.

1705
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:34,580
Yeah, I think it's something that can behave like-

1706
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:39,300
Yeah, okay.

1707
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:41,060
But I'm not sure how.

1708
01:16:42,020 --> 01:16:42,860
No, it's-

1709
01:16:42,860 --> 01:16:45,860
I think it's like an idea of, again,

1710
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:52,900
to learn AR, but it's also like generating something

1711
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:54,900
that's used to be in AR,

1712
01:16:55,900 --> 01:17:00,060
so as you're, and all of this with a normal phone,

1713
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:04,420
some individual device, so if you can,

1714
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:09,420
as you move along, let's say,

1715
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:12,260
there are things or problems going,

1716
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:16,460
but you really want to play,

1717
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:18,860
so it's basically detecting various areas of time

1718
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:20,700
and generating something.

1719
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:23,620
Yeah, that could be very cool too.

1720
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:26,940
Okay.

1721
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:29,020
Last call, anything else?

1722
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:32,460
All right, I'm super excited hearing just those ideas

1723
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:35,740
about what you guys will come up with.

1724
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:39,260
So as a reminder, go sign up for the sheet.

1725
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:41,780
Again, first come, first serve,

1726
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:43,620
so if you book a slot, it's yours.

1727
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:47,860
I do reserve the right to change the times,

1728
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:51,580
but generally, I won't change your team itself.

1729
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:53,300
But yeah, do that as soon as possible

1730
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:55,460
so that I know at least how many teams there are

1731
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:59,420
and I can organize the pitches on November 7th and all that.

1732
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:02,180
I will follow up with more details around the plan

1733
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:03,740
on November 7th about when you'll come

1734
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:06,260
into the CSUMB office and stuff like that.

1735
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:08,500
I'll post that all to a discussion.

1736
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:11,060
But otherwise, I'll hang out here.

1737
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:13,100
If you want to come ask any questions,

1738
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:15,380
ideally, you would have asked it in the class

1739
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:17,260
and I would have clarified it,

1740
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:19,460
but if there's something very, very personal to you

1741
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:21,780
that you want to ask, sure, come up.

1742
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:23,700
But otherwise, if you're coming up here

1743
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:25,020
and asking a question that applies

1744
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:26,380
to pretty much the entire class,

1745
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:28,820
I'll be like, go ask that on that discussion now

1746
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:31,060
and I'll answer it, okay?

1747
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:34,820
That's all I have, thank you.
